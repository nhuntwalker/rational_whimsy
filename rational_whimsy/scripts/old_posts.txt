It&#8217;s not technically complex, it doesn&#8217;t require some hidden knowledge to get right, but it&#8217;s the most human post I&#8217;ve written thus far, and because it cuts down to a really vulnerable part it&#8217;s difficult to get through. I\u00a0warn you now: it&#8217;s mostly stream-of-consciousness stuff so it&#8217;s not particularly well-written. If I name you and misrepresent you, I apologize. I also apologize if I meander a bit here and there. It&#8217;s been a long road to get here, and this is going to be a long post. Onward&#8230;</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>On March 24th, 2016 I left Astronomy, and it was by far the most difficult decision that I have ever made for myself to date. This was after 5.5 years at the graduate level, 3 years of undergrad Physics and Math building up to it, 1.5 years of undergrad business administration\u00a0prior to\u00a0that, and 1.5 years of fucking up at Binghamton University before that. I found my ambition and general zest for knowledge again through the lives and deaths of stars, and about a month and a half ago I left it behind. More than leaving behind the field, I left behind an identity; a high point of pride for myself and\u00a0my family, and damn if it isn&#8217;t one of the best decisions that I&#8217;ve ever made in my entire life. Let&#8217;s start at the start.</p>\n<p>I first fell in love with\u00a0the stars during the Spring semester of 2006. I was a Business Administration major at CUNY Queensborough Community College (QCC) intending to transfer onward to Baruch to become an accountant, and I\u00a0needed to take a science class for some sort of natural science credit. I didn&#8217;t want to work too hard at it so I chose Astronomy; it seemed easy enough and wow was it. No doubt my familiarity with Physics from high school helped but it was&#8230;yeah it was pretty simple. Even with that, as I learned about the stars and how they lived and died, along with the history of Astronomy and the larger concepts of our Universe, I fell more deeply in love with the Science. My professor at the time was <a href=\"http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/directory/FacultyDetail.aspx?personID=2048\">George Tremberger, Jr.</a>\u00a0and he picked up on my budding interest and asked me if I wanted to do some research over the Summer. One of the other professors had some grant money and could use a student to work with him doing some science. I had been planning to reach out to various accounting firms for an internship, but I was interested enough in the science that I took him up on it. That summer I used Excel (so young&#8230;so stupid) to read in some data from the Solar Heliospheric Observatory to try to detect fluctuations in the Sun&#8217;s light that could predict solar flares. My advisor was Dr. Tak Cheung and he was nice but&#8230;flawed. He wasn&#8217;t unique in that; he was the first in a string of flawed advisors that I&#8217;d have, but I&#8217;ll get there. He funded me but didn&#8217;t guide me much. That was tough, as\u00a0I had done all of one semester\u00a0of math-less intro-level astronomy. Regardless, I did some work, my results were inconclusive and I got to present\u00a0them at a local conference in NYC. Heh, I printed out my results on individual 8.5&#8243; x 11&#8243; sheets of paper and taped them to some poster board, Excel plots and all. Again, so young&#8230;</p>\n<p>I met a bunch of folks from the local NY astro scene at that conference and that was cool. I learned about an elective astronomy course at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) that was being taught by Charles Liu, friend and colleague to the illustrious Neil deGrasse Tyson, and I was encouraged to enroll so I did. Those classes were on Tuesday nights, so\u00a0every Tuesday evening in the Fall of 2006 I&#8217;d leave the QCC campus\u00a0after a full day of college classes and work as a math and accounting tutor to commute into the city.\u00a0For an hour and a half I&#8217;d ride the Q27, transfer to the 7 train, then again to the E train, walk through the bottom floor of AMNH to the lecture hall where I got a much better, much more fascinating introduction to stars living and dying. Supernova explosions! The conversion of mass directly into energy that became the light that made stars shine! The Big Bang! Black Holes! Holy shit this stuff was amazing, and I loved every damn minute of it. It was entirely worth the 1.5 hour trip in and the ~2.5 hour trip back out to Long Island every week. It was so interesting that it was a no brainer to sign up for the next semester&#8217;s course focusing on light and energy.</p>\n<p>Charles put me in touch with Timothy Paglione at CUNY York College, where I applied and got into the Physics and Math undergrad program. I had hoped to take some classes from him in astronomy and work with him to do\u00a0some research, but alas that wasn&#8217;t the case. Didn&#8217;t even get to take a Physics class from him. Boo! No matter, I had enrolled and damn if I wasn&#8217;t going to come out on top in the Physics program and put my best foot forward toward\u00a0astro. I started taking my first Physics class since SUNY Binghamton (which was god-awful and part of the reason I&#8217;d dropped out in the first place) and it was alright. The professor at the time wasn&#8217;t the best at conveying information, so I sought out the other professor teaching the same course across the hall, Gregory Boutis. He was awesome and taught me all my basic Physics. It was a great start and during the Fall semester that followed, pretty much until I left for Columbia&#8217;s bridge program\u00a0I worked in his lab doing not-Astronomy.</p>\n<p>The first real internship I got was in the summer of 2008, back at AMNH working with Charles. It was exciting because it would be\u00a0my first real step into the field, and in many ways it was a great introduction as to what to expect from my career in astronomy. A lot of awesome community amongst the students, very few people of color, and very little guidance from my advisor. I&#8217;m not gonna lie, that summer left me pretty pissed. Here I&#8217;d busted my ass to get into this program and I&#8217;d finally made it only to be left to flounder for half a summer. I had some support from the other students, and even a couple of the other advisors, but I was largely on my own trying to figure out what to do with myself. A huge fountain of support during that summer and onward even to this day was a student who&#8217;s been through it before, Amy Colon (now Gonzalez). When my advisor was nowhere to be found, she gave me the hands on guidance I needed. I&#8217;d had very little astro training and only a bit more physics training than that at the time, so I was just straight up lost more often than not. I ended up pulling something together and presenting at the end of the summer, but working without a clue\u00a0left a sour taste in my mouth. The other students did such great work and knew so much more than I did; I really started to question whether I belonged there at all.</p>\n<p>This trend continued in my next REU at the University of Wisconsin in 2009 where I looked\u00a0for X-ray sources in two dwarf galaxies. My advisor was a professor who had part time appointment there and in Italy, and she was somewhat hands off. I did a lot of re-inventing the wheel trying to figure out how to work with data from XMM-Newton, as well as trying to figure out what the hell I was supposed to be looking for in the first place, how to clean my data, how to interpret my data, what the hell an X-ray spectrum was and how to report hardness ratios, what a nova was, etc. Again, great support from the other students, some help from other faculty, not much guidance, sour taste. Great experience, but yeah a sour taste. If this sort of hands-off structure was the norm for astronomy, did I really belong? Would I really be able to make it in the field? A question for another time, because I was plowing ahead anyway.</p>\n<p>I went to a couple American Astronomical Society conferences along the way, presented my work, and met some people. In 2008 I met Marcel Agueros and he really looked out for me, pointing me toward the Columbia Bridge to the Ph.D. program in Astronomy for when I was ready to graduate. In 2009 I met some grad students\u00a0from the University of Washington and oh my god they were so awesome and laid back and accepting and\u00a0were 100% of the reason I chose to go there for graduate school. I also won a prize (yay!) for my poster on X-ray sources in the Fornax and Leo dwarf galaxies. Being at those conferences reinforced my feeling of community with the larger population of astronomers in and outside of the United States. The students were all great people doing great work, and everyone seemed willing to assist an up-and-coming student at all times. Still not many POC&#8217;s (but they did exist here and there!). Those were experiences I&#8217;d encourage any undergrad to go through.</p>\n<p>In 2009-2010 I finished my undergrad work at Columbia University as a part of the Bridge to the Ph.D. program, spending a lot of my time feeling extremely out of my depth. At York, all the physics classes beyond Physics 151 and 152 maxed out at like 8 students, so we all got a lot of attention. The profs made a strong effort to make sure that we got the material while still challenging us along the way. I appreciated that then and appreciate it still. This wasn&#8217;t the case\u00a0while I was at Columbia. Now, the Bridge program was great and taught me great things. I met great people and learned a ton. However, Quantum Mechanics destroyed me and was the first time I&#8217;d mentally checked out of Physics since 2003.\u00a0Radiative Processes in Astrophysics was less rough, but still had my eyes glazing over after a bit. It was the first time I&#8217;d felt really isolated in Physics/Astro; like I was so out of my depth because I didn&#8217;t belong. No matter, grit the teeth and bear it because there was a lot at stake and I couldn&#8217;t afford to flounder.</p>\n<p>My advisor while I was at Columbia was Jules Halpern (who also taught the Radiative Processes class). He was even more hands off than either of my previous advisors and I spent a lot of time where I should&#8217;ve been researching and learning to program just not knowing what the fuck I was doing. Just like&#8230;completely lost.\u00a0I had been hoping to at some point hit that Apprenticeship model that I&#8217;d had in my mind, where my advisor would spend a significant amount of time molding and shaping me into the type of researcher that could take on his legacy. I&#8217;d been hoping to find\u00a0it in my past few advisors as well and again came up disappointed. This became a common theme: disappointment at the lack of guidance. Disappointment in myself in not being able to conjure up my own direction and motivation. As a scientist you get trained to look for patterns and one was clearly emerging: my advisors thus far were varying degrees of absent. Maybe that&#8217;s just how they were? Maybe I wasn&#8217;t a compelling enough student to actually invest significant time in?</p>\n<p>When I talk about a lack of guidance and involvement, I don&#8217;t want to give the impression that I didn&#8217;t get any career-level guidance. The Bridge program was exceptional in that. Marcel took great care to make sure that we were able to sell ourselves extremely well on paper and through presentations. He stayed on our asses constantly to make sure we moved forward, and in those ways I flourished. However, my science work has\u00a0<em><strong>never</strong></em> experienced that level of involvement, so it didn&#8217;t grow in that same way. Anyway, onward to graduate school.</p>\n<p>Because of Marcel&#8217;s expert guidance in writing CVs, covers, and personal letters I was able to spin my isolation and mediocre science output due to lack of active mentorship into\u00a0proof of my ability to self-motivate and figure out my own path as a scientist. I figure that that and the research experiences I&#8217;d had up to that point are largely responsible for getting me into graduate schools I&#8217;d applied to. Still got some residual impostor syndrome going on there. I don&#8217;t know if\u00a0I&#8217;ll ever come to a point where I truly believe that my science skills were actually sufficient for the position that I got.</p>\n<p>I arrived in Seattle in late August 2010. It immediately felt different from NY where I&#8217;d up to that point spent my entire life. Everyone was so polite but impossible to build friendships with. The public transportation system was laughable. Everything closed at like 10pm. Oh, and there were like no black people. I think a little context is needed here. All through grade school I&#8217;d been in predominantly black and latino communities. QCC and York were also mostly black schools. Columbia was&#8230;quite free of melanin but it&#8217;s embedded in the Upper West Side of Harlem, which is still to some degree heavily melanated. So, moving to Seattle, where the demographics show between 6 and 8% blacks, was a huge culture shock. The University of Washington&#8217;s GO-MAP helped me survived, and later on in my grad career I built a community out of the POCs that went to their meetings. Capoeira definitely played a part in keeping my sanity, as it gave me instant community. The other astro grads also helped immensely; despite there being only one other black person in the department (including post-docs, faculty, and staff) I spent the majority of my social time during my first two years with the other astro grads.</p>\n<p>If it wasn&#8217;t for GO-MAP, capoeira, and the other grads I no doubt would&#8217;ve dropped first year. The other grad student I started working with on research was absent more often than not (working on thesis, traveling for stuff, other life things), and I was just drowning in school work. I managed to pull it through in most of my classes and worked\u00a0my ass off during second year along with the other grads in my cohort to pass the qualifying exam. Getting up to that point I had kept the notion in my mind that if I could just pass this exam it&#8217;d validate me being here. If I could just pass this exam, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to question whether or not I belonged. I passed the exam, but not the doubt.</p>\n<p>Throughout that time I had been doing research on red dwarf stars with Suzanne Hawley&#8217;s group. I had actually started with trying to work with Scott Anderson on some Sloan Digital Sky Survey data because he did high-energy astrophysics and at the time I was interested in that, but his style was hands off and he was also the department chair, so interactions were limited and not very fruitful for me. Suzanne on the other hand was (is) a beast. She was on all her undergrads, grad students, and post docs like white on rice. I particularly envied how well she kept up with her students professionally and personally, both past and present. I figured if I was gonna get the guidance I needed, she&#8217;d give it whether I wanted it her way or not (which is what I wanted). It worked out too; during second year the work that I&#8217;d done on the red dwarf AD Leo was shaped up for publication and pushed out (after many many revisions and much work). I had no idea what I&#8217;d do next but I figured if I could just be a part of her group I&#8217;d be solid.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately\u00a0when it was time for me to start thinking seriously about what thesis work I&#8217;d be doing and with who I&#8217;d be doing it with, she fell seriously ill. Then the year after she went on sabbatical, so that didn&#8217;t work out. I had however done some interesting work in my Galactic Structure class with the man who would become my advisor for the remainder of my grad school career, Zeljko Ivezic. He had us working on some new infrared data that we could use to map the entire sky much like it&#8217;d been done before with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; and those papers have been cited hundreds of times). He introduced me to Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, which are these red giant stars that are extremely bright and have some interesting internal and external physics. They pulsate, changing brightness by orders of magnitude, and they generate these dust clouds that make them ideal infrared targets. The work was truly interesting and I figured it had enough meat to it and possibility behind it where it could become a good thesis.</p>\n<p>Zeljko is a great guy and a fantastic scientist, but a horrible match for me as an advisor. I craved hands on guidance and regular, direct involvement. He&#8217;s a big name in the SDSS community, in other communities, and is the lead scientist for the telescope of the future, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will regularly capture petabytes of data and solve all the world&#8217;s problems. His various collaborations and responsibility to the community at large\u00a0make his time away from his office\u00a0on par with his time inside of it. Even without those commitments though, he&#8217;s not a real hands-on kind of guy (though he does start to turn the screws if progress is moving too slowly). So, when I started working for him,\u00a0it was pretty much immediately clear that it wouldn&#8217;t work out well for me. However I was interested in stars, and aside from Julianne Dalcanton, who already had her own legion\u00a0of\u00a0grad students, post-docs, research scientists, and her own international collaboration to manage with Hubble Space Telescope stuff, no one was really working on stars. So, I figured I&#8217;d grit my teeth again and just do what I could.\u00a0After all, I&#8217;d have to learn to be an independent scientist eventually, right? This could be seen\u00a0as just early prep. And so began\u00a0the next 3.5 years.</p>\n<p>There were other mitigating factors that led to my growing melancholy besides poor mentorship. Graduate students everywhere are <a href=\"http://rationalwhimsy.com/project/graduate-salaries-nationwide-interactive/\">notoriously poorly-paid</a>. When I started on in 2010 the salary was $18,300 per year, though it was funded through GO-MAP so I at least didn&#8217;t have to teach until the Spring quarter of 2011. After the qualifying exam, we got a small bump that amounted to about $100 more per month. I also started working on the planetarium as the technical coordinator, so that gave me 10% more each month\u00a0(which was quite nice) but still came under $22,000 per year. My third year was&#8230;slightly better-funded because I was on Zeljko&#8217;s grant, but at the end of that year the grant ran out and neither proposal we sent in afterward got funded. Without research funding, I had to TA the introductory astro classes and that was so emotionally draining. It&#8217;s hard to care and push forward when most of the 64 faces you see every other day contain nothing but apathy and contempt for being forced to take some stupid, irrelevant &#8220;natural worlds&#8221; credit. And then of course on top of having to grade mountains of paperwork every week I still had to try to push forward on research. In addition to that, and this is going to just sound petty, the constant drear of Seattle between the months of October and fucking July just wore on me. Being isolated from my family (including my brand new nephew)\u00a0and\u00a0lifelong friends (I visited a few times per year but not often enough), and having to manage a long-distance relationship (and the subsequent breakdown of the relationship when it became local in second year) just brought me down. Compound those with a criminal lack of diversity and the horrific\u00a0career prospects of\u00a0an astronomer. In grad school I finally got a clear picture of\u00a0what lie ahead: a\u00a0near-decade of post-doc purgatory, the gross undersupply\u00a0of faculty jobs, the grueling marathon of teaching, administrative, research, and mentoring work that comes with a faculty job, and the constant academic nomad status and work-life imbalance that came with all of that. I was climbing what first appeared\u00a0to be a small mountain but was actually the path to base camp at Mount Everest. Toward the end of my\u00a0third year, I started looking for an escape.</p>\n<p>One of my co-workers and eventual good friends, <a href=\"http://www.ifweassume.com/\">Jim Davenport</a>, would come around every so often and show me awesome data visualizations he had either seen or done himself. He inspired me to do my own, first as a means to learn my eventual programming language of choice\u2014glorious Python\u2014, and then just to explore personal projects of interest.\u00a0I did, and while I was involved in my own projects and blog posts I was, for those moments, free of feeling trapped in academia. Through pursuing my own projects I rediscovered my creativity, my ambition, and my passion for putting out meaningful work. It of course made the grad student experience that much worse, because I&#8217;d always have to come back to work that I was caring less and less about. Still, fulfillment lie in pulling on whatever thread my curiosity picked up, and so when I had off time I&#8217;d try some new shit. During this time, Data Science as a career seemed to just morph in out of the ether. I&#8217;d never heard of it before I&#8217;d entered grad school and it just seemed like a promise of a life that was too good to be true. Well compensated for curiosity and producing interesting work that relies heavily on data, analytical skill, creativity, aesthetic sense, and programming ability? What black magic was this? Is it even legal? How does it work? As I learned more about it and dove into more data projects, it increasingly seemed like the\u00a0yellow-brick road that would take me away from my deepening misery.\u00a0A couple of the senior grad students chose that path so it seemed more doable. Then my officemate Jake Vanderplas, Python and Statistics Guru, graduated and went on to become the director of UW&#8217;s\u00a0newly-constructed e-Science Institute. I wanted his brain and ability to make sense of damn near anything. I still do. When he ascended to his current throne, I started taking data science seriously.</p>\n<p>Another out, and the actual first domino to fall, came in during March of my fourth year (2014). I had been complaining to <a href=\"http://c.huntwalker.com/\">my brother</a>, as I often did, about how difficult it was to learn Python and MySQL on my own, as well as\u00a0how utterly broke\u00a0I was and how I&#8217;d love to have another stream of income. He owned his own business developing websites, and he\u00a0would tell\u00a0me how he&#8217;d pay me to work for him part time if I knew MySQL (I learned it by necessity for research) and would learn PHP, HTML, CSS, WordPress, JavaScript, and Photoshop. He&#8217;d brought this up to me several times prior to this, but I didn&#8217;t take him up on it because I figured there was no way I&#8217;d have the time to learn all that and still maintain sanity in grad school. However, leading up to this I&#8217;d also been gently pushing my lady at the time (now fianc\u00e9) to move across country and she finally agreed. That would take some dough to manage and between us we\u00a0had very little of it. Well, all that ability to teach myself shit due to absentee advisors since 2006 kicked my ass into gear, because I took him up on his offer. From March\u00a0to\u00a0June I spent 6am to 9am (or whenever I&#8217;d leave for school), as well as any free time I had after school, on weekends, and sometimes even during my workday teaching myself web development. The goal was to learn enough to do passable work, and I made it. Every day\u00a0between\u00a0June and late August I worked for my brother making $400 every two weeks building websites, waking up at 5:30 am and immediately starting work at 6 to sync up with his 9am on the East Coast. I&#8217;d work through to 10 am, then go off to campus where I&#8217;d stay\u00a0to about 6pm or so. Then I&#8217;d come home and continue working after hours on research if I needed to keep up my barest minimum, teaching stuff if I had things to grade, or more web dev practice. At the end of August I had to take a break because Zeljko sent me to Germany -&gt; Croatia -&gt; Italy for research (such a great experience).</p>\n<p>When I got back from my Eurotrip, I started back up\u00a0with my brother. Sure, the money was nice to have and was essential at the time. However,\u00a0aside from the money I flourished with the constant contact and immediate feedback. Doing good work made me feel good about myself, and the response was immediate so there was always a source for boosting my self-esteem after being beaten down by grad school for 4 years. Whether it was because this was his business and direct livelihood, or because I&#8217;m his brother, he gave a shit, and the difference was felt and appreciated every day. I&#8217;d work with him off and on as time would permit for the next year and a half.</p>\n<p>I loved having my work, and by extension myself, matter\u00a0so much that at the end of my fourth year I began seriously entertaining the idea of dropping out of grad school altogether. He would dissuade me many\u00a0times; he believed in the power of the paper that says Ph.D. He and my father would convince me that I would be wasting all the time I&#8217;d spent up to that point; that I was so close to finishing that it made sense to just keep gritting my teeth and white knuckling it through to the end. Aside from them though, I had to work on a few internal things. For one, I didn&#8217;t feel like my skills and credentials would be good enough for either a data science job (where they regularly reject\u00a0Ph.D&#8217;s) or a web developer position (I&#8217;d\u00a0<em><strong>just</strong></em> started learning it, and I was passable at best).\u00a0Second, I\u00a0<em><strong>was</strong></em> so close. I was steady working on my thesis proposal and on deck to go through my General Exam, which is the last gateway to the dissertation and those magic three letters. Maybe I should\u00a0just stick it out? Third, my identity was heavily coupled to astronomy. What would I be without it? Where could I go? What could I do? What use was I to the world if I wasn&#8217;t studying space, this thing I&#8217;d built myself up into doing over what was now about 8 years of time? Sure I was miserable, but so the fuck what? That was my problem to fix, and if I was a better astronomer I would probably not be so miserable. In order to leave, I&#8217;d have to leave my identity behind. I&#8217;d have to abandon\u00a0my astronomy support system, my international community, the bulk of my knowledge base. I&#8217;d have to abandon who I&#8217;d become up to that point. These points kept me struggling with whether or not to leave for almost another two years.</p>\n<p>As I fought myself on leaving, my misery deepened. I was quickly caring less and less about research, about my astro career, about anything that had to do with the science. I became aimless and deeply\u00a0unproductive, awakening and polishing up my code\u00a0whenever I knew a meeting with Zeljko was on the horizon. My only joy for my work came when my work was my own. When I was studying hip hop lyrics, or researching personal finance, or building D3 visualizations, or anything else that you see on this here site. February 2015 I fought through my general exam and came out of it triumphant, but just so totally drained.\u00a0I couldn&#8217;t give a first damn about any of it anymore. If I did work it was to satisfy some minimum. If I didn&#8217;t care, why press forward?</p>\n<p>I put my efforts into studying data science and looking for internships for that summer. That was an abject failure, but you&#8217;ve gotta start somewhere right?\u00a0The summer came and I didn&#8217;t have an internship so I taught again. When I had open nights I&#8217;d go to Python, JavaScript, and web development meet-ups trying to get my foot into the local community. Expenses were getting heavy due to the new living arrangement with the lady\u00a0so I also\u00a0worked for my brother, and because I wanted to be a better web developer I jumped deep into learning more about making dynamic sites in JavaScript using <a href=\"http://www.freecodecamp.com\">FreeCodeCamp</a>. At the time, FreeCodeCamp outsourced some of its lessons to sites like <a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/\">Code School</a> and <a href=\"http://www.udacity.com\">Udacity</a>. Well, to help handle expenses I took out some student loans, and with the extra money I decided to take a shot in the dark and in October I enrolled in Udacity&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002\">nanodegree program in Data Analysis</a>. It was a small time commitment, an affordable financial commitment, and because I&#8217;d been a scientist for so long, a lot of the analysis work would be (and was) simple to execute. Around the same time, I&#8217;d been bitching on Twitter about my graduate school misery and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IBJIYONGI\">Chanda Prescod-Weinstein</a>, a post-doc who&#8217;d come to UW to give a job talk, decided to take me under her wing and be my support system. She kept in touch with me regularly and put me in touch with other astronomers of color that she knew, as\u00a0she didn&#8217;t want to see another one of us fall through the cracks. I&#8217;m ever grateful. Julianne also stepped in and insisted that I meet with her regularly to progress steadily through research. Because of her urging, I made more progress than I would have on my own. But, I had other things weighing on my mind that needed dealing with.</p>\n<p>Through Chanda, I got in touch with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/astrojohnjohn\">John Asher Johnson</a>\u00a0who was generous enough to take like an hour out of his day to give me some career counseling. We had a very candid conversation, and I came out of it feeling like if I had to white knuckle it all the way to the Ph.D. finish, it may be worth my time to explore other avenues. More than that though was that it was okay to feel that way and do what&#8217;s best for me. Getting that sort of permission to do whatever I needed to do to get myself right was groundbreaking for me. A few weeks after talking to him, I started applying for jobs.</p>\n<p>From October 2015 through to this March I in some way, shape, or form applied to 35 companies in and out of Seattle. Out of those I landed interviews at 5 places, only one of which I had actually formally applied to. The other four I had gotten to the interview phase by some manner of personal connection, networking, or just sheer luck. I totally bombed my first interview too; I&#8217;d never done whiteboard work before. I&#8217;d been asked some questions about text manipulation and I&#8217;d only done brute force work up to that point. I&#8217;d also been asked some pretty advanced MySQL questions that I&#8217;d never even though to study, as I&#8217;d been using MySQL for years at that point and never needed more than just the basics. At that company I&#8217;d gotten two more interviews in a different department that I actually did pretty well at, but management had other ideas. I learned tons from my interviews at that company. I got my live question chops up, beefed up my projects from my Udacity Nanodegree program, and got a few more interviews. My projects sparkled on my resume and whenever I was asked to talk about them their quality came through. I eventually got to my interview at <a href=\"http://www.codefellows.com\">Code Fellows</a>. Through some manner of serendipity I managed to meet the Code Fellows COO at a fundraiser for the TAF Academy here in Seattle. He introduced me to the CEO who I had stupidly not paid much attention to at all (sorry Dave!), as well as the VP of Education who I ended up chatting with for quite a while. He encouraged me to send my info in, and they invited me for an interview. I arrived for that interview a week early because&#8230;reasons. It was on a Friday and I didn&#8217;t look hard enough at the date. A week after I went through that interview proper I came back to give a guest lecture for their Python dev accelerator class, talking about some of the many ways that we use Python in astronomy. The Monday following that lecture I was given an offer. The Thursday following that Monday I started work as an Assistant Instructor of Python.</p>\n<p>Since being at Code Fellows I&#8217;ve learned at light speed again. I&#8217;ve picked up a framework for building large-scale websites with Python, learned (and taught) about web app security, learned (and assisted students with) data structures, algorithms, workflows, project management mentalities, self-management mentalities, student management mentalities. I&#8217;ve learned that you can&#8217;t shoot students in the face with data science in a week without sufficient math background or else they&#8217;ll rebel. I&#8217;ve reacquainted myself with the value of consistent supervisor meetings. I now know what it&#8217;s like to feel like everything I do contributes to something greater that extends beyond just what advances my own career. I&#8217;m currently revising the Python curriculum for the classes to come, one of which I&#8217;ll hopefully be teaching full time, and I&#8217;m happy every day. Stressed for sure, and still working on the work-life balance thing, but I&#8217;m so damn happy. I have dreams about how I can contribute to the company. I&#8217;m optimistic about the future, about the classes I&#8217;ll be teaching, about how I can assist the students, and these are easily the best students I&#8217;ve ever taught. They&#8217;re so invested in the material; it&#8217;s refreshing to be around students who give at least as much of a shit as I do. They push themselves, and while they may complain about the deluge of work we&#8217;ve given them, they push us to challenge them daily. More than the management, the students motivate\u00a0me to become\u00a0the best instructor I can be, and I work on that daily. I look forward to when I&#8217;m directly shaping minds again myself (soon!)\u00a0and can give them all the guidance that I can squeeze out of my brain. Sure, it&#8217;s not data science, which was my intended path, but the organization is flexible and growing such that it&#8217;s not a far-fetched idea that I (we) could create a curriculum that can train junior data-literate software developers. Here, I see nothing but growth or the potential for growth.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting though. I&#8217;m so happy that every once in a while I have a hard time believing that it&#8217;s real. I still feel like I cheated the system\u2014that someone&#8217;s going to find out that I don&#8217;t actually belong where I am, doing what I&#8217;m doing, and that I&#8217;m going to have to go back to a life of inertia (hello again, Impostor Syndrome). It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t love the science of astronomy. I still want to learn about stars and galaxies and shit like that, HOWEVER I&#8217;ve been out a month and a half and I have zero desire to go back. Returning to that isn&#8217;t about the science for me. It&#8217;s about the misery and isolation associated with it. It&#8217;s about gritting my teeth again, being isolated again, being poor again, having to negotiate research meetings for a month from now, feeling shitty that I don&#8217;t do as much as others, feeling shitty about not being that high on my advisor&#8217;s radar, and having to lie to myself and others (friends, family, other grad students, faculty, randoms that can&#8217;t help but ask &#8220;so when are you going to finish?&#8221;) through a forced smile every single day about what I&#8217;m doing with my life.</p>\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve left the stars behind. There&#8217;s always going to be some guilt there, though far less than I&#8217;d expected. I still have to manage disappointment from family and acquaintances; I know dad really wanted to see me get that Ph.D. I&#8217;m sorry dad, but I can&#8217;t do that. To other black astronomers both present and future, I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t join your ranks and decrease the isolation by one. I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t be a role model for aspiring black Ph.D.&#8217;s. I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t validate being included in Columbia&#8217;s Bridge program, or the efforts that every advisor both direct and indirect put forward into getting me as far as I got. I&#8217;m sorry other black Ph.D. students at UW that I&#8217;ve shared drinks and\u00a0dark thoughts about the\u00a0ongoing life-abuse that is grad school. I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m happy, and I&#8217;m going to take this as far as I can go.</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n"}, "modified": "2016-05-18T07:04:09", "date_gmt": "2016-05-18T06:52:45", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=273", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=273", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/273"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/273/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=273"}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=273", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>This is a\u00a0hard post to write.

After all, &#8220;A goal without a plan is just a wish&#8221; (Antoine de Saint-Exupery). As such, I want to identify the behavior that I want to introduce/change, and with it produce a realistic plan of action so that it can actually get done. If anything, it&#8217;ll end up resembling a list of actionable challenges. And I have quite a few, so this will just list the first few, and I&#8217;ll post the rest later.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with a basic list from which we flesh out the plans:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Begin reading comfortably in Portuguese</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Run half marathon</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Advanced level of fitness</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Better relationship with family</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Talk at NerdNite February 2016</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Start blogging again (even short ones)</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Read more books</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Start down the path of a statistician</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">More D3 data projects</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Have an engagement party</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Start planning a wedding in earnest</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">As many green boxes as is sensible</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Backflip? Backflip.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Finish the nanodegree</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I think that&#8217;s a good place to start. Let&#8217;s go through each, flesh it out beyond just a &#8220;wish&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Begin reading comfortably in Portuguese</b></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The issue</b>: For a couple years now I&#8217;ve been using DuoLingo to keep my Portuguese knowledge up and current. However, the vocab list of DuoLingo is, while extensive, quite limited. It&#8217;s also very proper Portuguese instead of what&#8217;s more colloquial. What&#8217;s more, all the reading that I&#8217;ve done for the DuoLingo coursework is in short burts of individual words, or single phrases/sentences. So, I don&#8217;t have that good of a sense of how to read lengthy texts of portuguese.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The plan</b>: 2-3 times per week, use DuoLingo&#8217;s Immersion feature. I need ot make a habit out of it in order for it to stick (and for me to get better at it)</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>When I miss a day or two</b>: Just get back at it like I normally do when I miss a day or two (or five) of my regular Duolingo practice. Start on an article and just get into it.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Run a half marathon</b></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The issue</b>: I promised a friend of mine that I&#8217;d do a half marathon with him in May, but I haven&#8217;t consistently run in about two months. It&#8217;s difficult to get motivation up at 6:30 am when all you want to do is sleep.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The plan</b>: I need to train up for it, and mornings are the only way to this. One thing that worked (once) was to think to myself &#8220;What would the better version of myself do right now?&#8221;. 30 minute runs in the morning, no matter the distance. I should also throw in a progressively longer run on weekends, as I need to train up to the 13.1 miles this will take from me. Again, mornings. Saturdays are best.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>When I miss a day or two</b>: Depends. If its a morning run missed, do leg exercises at home (squats, swings, lunges). If it&#8217;s a weekend run missed, then the next weekend don&#8217;t advance forward in time.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Advanced Level of Fitness</b></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The issue</b>: Time is the great equalizer, and it&#8217;s slowing me down. I can feel it. And though I&#8217;ve had the benefit of some truly spectacular genes thus far keeping my body in shape (and let&#8217;s be honest, I move around a lot), I can&#8217;t continue to rely on my default fitness level for the rest of my life. The half-marathon is a short-term goal. In 4 months it&#8217;ll be done. I need to decide what type of fitness I want, and pursue that with consistency.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The plan</b>: I&#8217;ve realized that fitting in a set of bodyweight exercises and weightlifting activities is easy when I do it while doing other things.</span>\n<ul class=\"ul2\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Watching TV/movie? Exercise. Waiting for something to cook/sautee? Squats and lunges. Fitting exercise into the little spaces makes it that much more achievable.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">There&#8217;s also Capoeira on Saturdays which I need to make consistent, and Body Pump on Sundays, which we need to get back to after this month is over (gotta avoid the resolutioners).</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">As I restart/continue my morning runs, I cannot neglect the routine that I used to have, of knocking out pushups and pullups at that little part of Green Lake with the pull-up bar. I was making steady progress before. I can make it again.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>When I miss a day or two</b>: The bodyweight and weight training stuff at home isn&#8217;t as consistent, so it&#8217;s not much of an issue. With everything else, it&#8217;s more about mindset than modifying my training regimen. I need to know that it&#8217;s ok that I missed a session, and that I can get right back on the horse the next day. I need to believe it to be true like I believe in the rising of the Sun.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Better Relationship with Family/Friends</b></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The issue</b>: As with other things, I&#8217;m getting older, as is everyone else in my family. I&#8217;m turning 30 in April. My dad is turning 69, and my mom 61. As much as I hate to think about it, their time is limited, and everyone else&#8217;s time ticks forward as well. Their lives are all moving ahead and I&#8217;m not there to join them in that journey. It&#8217;s imperative that I get a better relationship with them, especially because I&#8217;m on the opposite coast.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The plan</b>: I already speak to my friends basically daily in group. What I need to do is routinely contact them individually. B calls me weekly, but I shouldn&#8217;t have to depend on him to call me to get in touch with him. I&#8217;ll start reaching out to each of them weekly just to catch up. D on weekends, as that&#8217;s when he&#8217;s most likely free. Everyone else can get a call on weekdays. As far as family goes, I have so much damn family that I&#8217;m going to just be texting most of them. I&#8217;ve already started a habit of texting Kayla more or less randomly. Need to text my other cousins too. Calling my mother is a lot easier now that she&#8217;s no longer teaching, and I need to call my dad when he&#8217;s home during the day so I can reach out to him and we can know each other better.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>When I miss a day or two</b>: Just pick a different day. It&#8217;s not that serious, as long as the effort is consistent (even if the days aren&#8217;t). Also don&#8217;t be afraid to text at odd hours. As long as they get a message.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Talk at NerdNite February 2016</b></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The issue</b>: NerdNite February 2016 is in about a month and I&#8217;ve barely started my talk. And it&#8217;s going to take quite a bit of work.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The plan</b>: One night a week until the talk, it gets my full focus. The weekend before, it&#8217;s all I work on (unless something is truly urgent). I already have data of sorts for Yemanja and Oxum. I need all the rest. Focusing on one or more per week is doable. My best night to work on this sort of thing is either Wednesday or Thursday.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>When I miss a day or two</b>: If I miss a Wednesday, work on a Thursday. If I miss both, Saturday or Sunday.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Start blogging again (even short nonsense ones)</b></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The issue</b>: It&#8217;s been more than 6 months since my last post of any kind. My site is basically derelict. I haven&#8217;t made any new projects and I haven&#8217;t written about anything interesting.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>The plan</b>: One post per month, whether it&#8217;s a blog post or a project post. A little writing every day will do wonders.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><b></b><span class=\"s1\"><b>When I miss a day or two</b>: Just get back on it the next day. As with most of my habits that I drop, I need to remind myself that it&#8217;s OK to lapse a bit. There&#8217;s no race to win, and there&#8217;s no consequence for stopping and starting. All that matters is that I do start again.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think that&#8217;s good enough for now. I&#8217;m still fleshing out the rest, so look forward to the next one! Hopefully these plans will help me accomplish these goals over the next 11.5 months. Till next time!</p>\n"}, "modified": "2016-01-16T04:39:07", "date_gmt": "2016-01-16T04:38:17", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=268", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=268", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/268"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/268/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:featuredmedia": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/269", "embeddable": true}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=268", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=268"}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>I want this to not just be a list of things that I want to do, as that&#8217;s as dismissible as any other list.

Of course, there are some counties that are doing far better (e.g. Columbia &amp; Garfield counties; grad rates of 96.7% &amp; 96.4%), while some are in what appears to be a graduation crisis (e.g. Clallam &amp; Stevens counties; grad rates of 49.7% &amp; 64.7%). Further study may reveal some correlation of graduation rate with median household income, or another economic marker, but this is a start.</p>\n<p>We can, of course, also ask the question of how these counties have performed over time. A county may appear &#8220;good&#8221; now, but it may be on the decline if examined over a period of a few years. The following map looks into that question and shows the overall change in graduation rate over about 7 years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/differential_grad_rate.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-252\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/differential_grad_rate.png?resize=460%2C288\" alt=\"differential_grad_rate\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/differential_grad_rate.png?w=460 460w, http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/differential_grad_rate.png?resize=300%2C188 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is a very promising map for Washington state, as it shows that over the past 7 years almost all counties have managed to improve on their graduation rates. Unfortunately, Stevens is down, as is Jefferson on the west side of the state, but most are seeing positive growth. Whatever initiatives have taken place over that seven year period are showing results!</p>\n<p>Now, graduation rates and changes over time may paint a positive picture of education in Washington state as a whole, but only one dimension of it. It&#8217;s taking all the results from all possible breakdowns of the data and flattening it, so we only see one side of a multi-faceted issue. The racial breakdown tells a different story.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grad_rate_2007_2014.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-253\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grad_rate_2007_2014.png?resize=750%2C409\" alt=\"grad_rate_2007_2014\" srcset=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grad_rate_2007_2014.png?w=792 792w, http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grad_rate_2007_2014.png?resize=300%2C164 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>This data makes one fact painfully clear:\u00a0<em><strong>for a K-12 student that isn&#8217;t white, the public school system is failing.</strong></em>\u00a0Note: I&#8217;ve excluded asians &amp; pacific islanders in this analysis as the 7-year data set combines them as one population for a few years, then separates them later on.\u00a0For blacks and hispanics, there is potential for a brighter future though rates appear to have stabilized within a few percent. First Nations students, however, aren&#8217;t making the cut. Their rates seem to fluctuate wildly, and appear to be trending downward since 2010. A closer look at the data shows low numbers, so they may be suffering from small changes in small numbers translating into larger percentage changes overall, but I&#8217;m willing to bet that it&#8217;s more than just a statistical difference. First Nations students are being particularly failed by the state of Washington, and I&#8217;d like to hear more about any programs targeting their a) retention, and b) mentoring/nurturing.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for now.

What will I do after I get out of grad school? How much will I make? What type of life will I be able to sustain? I got to thinking about what type of salary I&#8217;d be able to command and what that&#8217;d look like each month. Then I realized that I hadn&#8217;t accurately accounted for taxes, or the effect of marriage. I looked up federal tax tables (<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2013/10/31/irs-announces-2014-tax-brackets-standard-deduction-amounts-and-more/\">here</a>) and realized it&#8217;d be a royal pain in the ass to try to calculate taxes for every individual salary I wanted to test, let alone accounting for marital status and whatnot. So, instead of doing each calculation individually, I decided to fire up Python and play with lots of numbers. If you want to see the calculations yourself, my python code is here (<a href=\"http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/nhuntwalker/mystuff/blob/master/blog/interestPost/Fed%20and%20State%20Taxes%202014.ipynb\">link</a>). Here&#8217;s the results!</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nVKMkv1ua-Y/VKN_PdO1hZI/AAAAAAAAA9s/xcwINxKFbEM/s1600/taxes_WANY.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nVKMkv1ua-Y/VKN_PdO1hZI/AAAAAAAAA9s/xcwINxKFbEM/s1600/taxes_WANY.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"211\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>I calculated the amount of taxes for salaries in various tax brackets. If you want to know more details about how things were calculated, follow the asterisk (*) to the bottom of the page. You can probably tell where each bracket begins/ends by the kinks in the lines. The blue lines represent single people, while the red lines represent married people. Solid lines are strictly calculating federal income tax, and would represent the total tax for people in these states: . \u00a0Dashed lines are federal and state income tax for people anywhere in New York State (except Yonkers and and the five boroughs), and dotted lines are specifically for people living in NYC. And in case you can&#8217;t read the axes here, the amount of money represented is the number on the axis times $1,000. Thus, if you&#8217;re single and making $80,000 per year, your federal income tax bill for 2014 should be about $20,000, and so on.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GuTFPUB7ezo/VKcwgwC4zjI/AAAAAAAAA-k/OpbW5NbILuM/s1600/marriage.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GuTFPUB7ezo/VKcwgwC4zjI/AAAAAAAAA-k/OpbW5NbILuM/s1600/marriage.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"256\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>The first thing to notice here is that no matter where you live, being married carries with it a pretty sizable benefit (at least as far as paying taxes is concerned). And I didn&#8217;t even include the (tax) benefit of having a buttload of kids! So if you&#8217;re making $80,000 per year and dating let&#8217;s say an unemployed philosopher, put a ring on it and save yourselves about $6,000 per year (roughly $500 per month). <a href=\"http://nhuntwalker.blogspot.com/2014/02/long-term-investing-how-much-growth-is.html\">Hell, throw that extra money into an IRA</a>!</p>\n<p>The next obvious thing to notice is that to exist in the state or city of New York means to live with extra hands in your pockets (especially in the latter locale). Now why&#8217;d I pick New York to bully? Laziness and familiarity. I&#8217;m from there, so I&#8217;m somewhat interested in its economics, and I may end up back there in the end. Who knows? But hey, I&#8217;m in Washington state now, and we&#8217;ve got no city or state income tax so haha**! Anyway yeah, tax-wise, being married in New York city or state is about as bad as\u2014if not worse than\u2014being single <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_income_tax#States_with_no_individual_income_tax\">anywhere without income tax</a>. For example, let&#8217;s take a salary of about $80,000. In Washington state, that&#8217;d yield a tax bill of about $19,500 if you&#8217;re single, ~$14,000 if you&#8217;re married (and your <u>total</u>\u00a0household income was $80K). In New York state, that&#8217;s a tax bill of $23,750 and $17,500 respectively. In NYC, $26,500 and $20,250 respectively. You pay about $3-4,000 extra just for the privilege of living in NY state, and another $2.5-3,000 on top of that to experience city life. That&#8217;s a little cray cray.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ypknG-nqezE/VKcnt8nkzwI/AAAAAAAAA98/w9fLfnx4oKM/s1600/taxes_WANY_prct.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ypknG-nqezE/VKcnt8nkzwI/AAAAAAAAA98/w9fLfnx4oKM/s1600/taxes_WANY_prct.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"211\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r2KlzgmXHG4/VKcw-Tr5TaI/AAAAAAAAA-w/PLobOmZcjMU/s1600/wave-slavery.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r2KlzgmXHG4/VKcw-Tr5TaI/AAAAAAAAA-w/PLobOmZcjMU/s1600/wave-slavery.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>The last not-so-obvious thing here though is that these taxes are detrimental to those that make the least. Above I&#8217;ve plotted the total percentage your taxes taken out of your gross income for the same income levels and circumstances above. Now let me explain my point: fed/state/city taxes are structured to adjust with your income, however living day-to-day is not. Whether you make $14,000 per year (roughly minimum wage) or $1.4 million per year, a 4-lb bag of frozen chicken breasts is still about $12 down at Safeway, and the bus/train/whatever still costs about $2.50 to use each time. Granted, if you&#8217;re making $1.4 million per year you&#8217;re probably not getting the $12 bag of chicken at Safeway. But, let&#8217;s scale up the impact it&#8217;d have on that salary. $12 chicken to someone that makes $14,000 per year is equal to about $1,200 for someone making $1.4 million. That&#8217;s some expensive chicken, even if you are a millionaire..</p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re fresh out of undergrad or grad school, you&#8217;re single (as far as the IRS is concerned), and you live in NYC, I&#8217;m sorry. Cause that $50,000 starting salary is getting $13,700+ sucked out for taxes, and then you&#8217;ve still gotta pay rent (~$10,000 per year), buy food (please, eat out as little as possible, cause that might be another $10,000), get that metrocard, pay back those student loans, pay off that/those credit card(s), and still try to enjoy life. Better get yourself an inexpensive hobby, or hell maybe one that pays. There&#8217;s spots on subway platforms for every talent.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n7gw-13GIqc/VKcq13dWX2I/AAAAAAAAA-I/6yOoFMNWvnA/s1600/income_expenses_compare.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n7gw-13GIqc/VKcq13dWX2I/AAAAAAAAA-I/6yOoFMNWvnA/s1600/income_expenses_compare.png\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>I actually became more interested in what expenses would look like for someone making about that, so I figured it out. Above, we have the financial life of Mr. Johnny Averageface. He makes the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acsbr12-02.pdf\">median American salary</a> ($50k; green), has average fun ($300/mo; blue), buys average food and eats out averagely ($150/wk; gray), <a href=\"http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml\">pays averagely</a> on his <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/04/pf/college/student-loan-debt/\">average student loans</a> ($345/mo on $30k of debt; orange), on his <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-card-data/average-credit-card-debt-household/\">average credit card debt</a> ($312/mo on $15k of debt; purple), on his average rent ($1,300/mo; yellow), and is taxed appropriately (red). Wow, rent is a bitch. But hey, taxes are giving rent a run for it&#8217;s money (well, Mr. Averageface&#8217;s money) in NYC.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s the takeaway(s) here? Get married, find a cheaper apartment, and don&#8217;t live in NYC. Also, not mentioned much above but for the hell of it here, <a href=\"http://nhuntwalker.blogspot.com/2014/02/long-term-investing-how-much-growth-is.html\">put your money in a goddamn IRA</a> already! Whatever you put in reduces your tax bill, gains interest (as long as the US economy doesn&#8217;t collapse), and gives you something to eat early-bird specials and live in south Florida with when you&#8217;re in your twilight years.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Happy New Year!</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wMBAntDcCnE/VKcxODmIGOI/AAAAAAAAA-4/PXuwZTvjLEg/s1600/Happy-New-Year-2015.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wMBAntDcCnE/VKcxODmIGOI/AAAAAAAAA-4/PXuwZTvjLEg/s1600/Happy-New-Year-2015.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<div>\n<p><i>Note, while the numbers quoted in text are approximated and rounded (because no one likes to see 12,736.04 instead of 12,700), the numbers in the figures are exact.</i></p>\n<p><i>* These are using the 2014 tax brackets for US federal, New York State, and New York City income tax.

However, if you&#8217;re still reading, you might actually be interested in what that energy budget looks like. So let&#8217;s jump into this, with the knowledge that\u00a0<b>the short answer is <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Metric+Fuckton\">a lot</a></b>. For this calculation, we need a mass. I&#8217;ll use myself as an example, as I (in my grand bias) feel that I&#8217;m about average height and weight for a healthy adult male. Last I checked, I&#8217;m 180 lbs\u2014so 81.8 kg. I&#8217;m going to accelerate myself to 40% light speed with an acceleration of 3g, then continue on at that speed forever. I&#8217;m choosing this speed because a) it&#8217;s damn fast, and b) it&#8217;s at about the threshold where relativity starts to really matter (the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor#Numerical_values\">Lorentz factor</a>\u00a0is what you have to multiply your mass by given some speed). The interesting thing here is that once I&#8217;ve accelerated up to the speed I want and I&#8217;ve left the Sun&#8217;s gravity (and am far from other sources of gravity), I really don&#8217;t\u00a0<i>need</i>\u00a0to expend much more energy. You can thank the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-1/Newton-s-First-Law\">law of inertia</a>\u00a0for that, as objects in motion stay in motion unless acted on by something else.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xOkUt2SVA10/VKHJDGtjAXI/AAAAAAAAA8o/Ayj2pCI0b8A/s1600/STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xOkUt2SVA10/VKHJDGtjAXI/AAAAAAAAA8o/Ayj2pCI0b8A/s1600/STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"204\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>So the majority of my energy budget is spent in that first period of acceleration. I calculate this by figuring out how much\u00a0<a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/work.html\">work</a>\u00a0my\u00a0<i>massless</i><i>\u00a0</i>spaceship (basically no spaceship) needs to do (not accounting for relativity). The energy required for moving my mass <i>alone</i>\u00a0up to 40% light speed is about 590 quadrillion Joules, which means nothing to you so let&#8217;s make it more relatable. That amount of energy is about the same amount consumed by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/state/seds/data.cfm?incfile=/state/seds/sep_fuel/html/fuel_te.html&amp;sid=US\">the entire state of North Dakota in 2012</a>. But hey, like\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota#Population\">no one lives in North Dakota</a>. And, that&#8217;s JUST my mass\u2014I&#8217;d need to be in a shuttle. The now-retired space shuttle\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle\">weighs about 2,030 tons</a>, most of which is the weight of the fuel. I&#8217;m not going to bother adding my mass to that. That&#8217;s just stupid, like considering the effect of the weight of an individual grain of dust on your own weight. Anyway, the shuttle (including the thrusters) weighs that much and only accelerates for about 600 seconds (or 10 minutes). Let&#8217;s do the entirely wrong thing and directly scale up the weight of the shuttle by the time needed to go through the whole acceleration period we calculated earlier: 47 days or 4.06 million seconds. That&#8217;s a factor of about 6,800! So you&#8217;d probably have to increase the mass of your shuttle to a number around 12.5 billion kg!!!</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tapuqCApxdM/VKHJr_ddyOI/AAAAAAAAA8w/CpzLVKQ9ygw/s1600/Sts_et_cutaway.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tapuqCApxdM/VKHJr_ddyOI/AAAAAAAAA8w/CpzLVKQ9ygw/s1600/Sts_et_cutaway.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"256\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p><b>Note </b>that this is not at all the definitive answer of how heavy the new shuttle would be, just a poor ballpark figure. There&#8217;s a host of other things to keep in mind here. For example, with every pound of fuel you add into your shuttle to push it some extra distance, you have to also include enough fuel to push that extra pound. You have to also include more metal to make a bigger fuel tank, and then include enough fuel to account for that extra metal. You have to also consider that we eventually drop fuel tanks once they&#8217;ve been exhausted, and that we always include a bit more fuel than is actually needed. As you can see, it&#8217;s a little more complicated than simply scaling things. However, I don&#8217;t want to do all that so I&#8217;m just going with the na\u00efve base answer, and am\u00a0<a href=\"http://assets.diylol.com/hfs/5df/6e7/e54/resized/engineering-professor-meme-generator-the-proof-is-left-as-an-exercise-for-the-reader-359485.jpg\">leaving it as an exercise for the reader</a> to figure out how to do it more precisely.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the fact that that new weight is entirely impractical and wrong, the energy needed to get that shuttle mass up to 40% light speed over 47 days is now not 590 quadrillion Joules, but about 90 trillion trillion Joules (we&#8217;re talking nonsense numbers here).\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption\">In 2008,\u00a0<i>the entire world</i>\u00a0consumed not even a fraction of a fraction of that</a>.

They would set up the stand on a busy street corner, sell the pie in slices for some amount per slice, be wildly successful, and they&#8217;d get all their spending money off of that business.

Or rather, <b>how much would it cost to sell an apple pie?</b></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Everything that follows is based on the recipe found here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cinnamon-Crumble-Apple-Pie-108650\">http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cinnamon-Crumble-Apple-Pie-108650</a>, the prices of things at Safeway (get those sales boy!), and the sales tax rate in Seattle (currently 9.5%). I&#8217;m not including the costs of actually driving to get the ingredients, the electricity/gas it takes to cook the pies, or other things that are just available at home like water. I&#8217;m also not getting fancy with it and including gluten-free anything or whole wheat flour or whatever else.

The next thing to go before the next grocery store trip is clearly butter, since one run to the grocery store will only bring back enough apples and butter to make one pie. That, my friends, would be a waste of all those other ingredients. Let&#8217;s just say we buy however many bags of apples and boxes of butter we&#8217;d need. So what&#8217;s next? It&#8217;s a close race, but the flour actually goes just before the sugar does. <b>You could make about 7 pies</b> with that amount of flour (7.25 pies really, but who&#8217;s making a quarter pie?).

Now, I want to start with the assumption that we can already reach light speed, and talk about just how damn large our Milky Way galaxy is. So, let&#8217;s begin:</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">2. Traveling at light speed, would we be able to travel outside the Milky Way with either manned or unmanned spacecraft?</span></h3>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><!--more--><br />\nSo now, by some means we&#8217;ve accelerated up to our speed of light, and we want to travel outside\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way\">the Milky Way</a>. The short answer is\u00a0<b>no, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to travel outside the Milky Way,\u00a0</b>but let&#8217;s look at this in stages. First we have to leave the Solar System. We characterize the size of the Solar System by where the Sun&#8217;s gravity no longer dominates. This is about 1-2 light years away from the Sun; let&#8217;s say 1 light year. So, 1 full year at light speed to leave the Solar System. That&#8217;s a start.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br />\n</span><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RtduM5PXd0g/VJIPN_JzIfI/AAAAAAAAA7A/eY5moBKL-Bk/s1600/galaxy-schematic.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RtduM5PXd0g/VJIPN_JzIfI/AAAAAAAAA7A/eY5moBKL-Bk/s1600/galaxy-schematic.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"242\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Now the Milky Way itself has a decent bit of structure, where the disk of the Milky Way (i.e. where most of the stars, gas, and dust are) has a thin component (~ 500 parsecs or 1,631 light years), and a thick component (~ 1,000 parsecs or 3,262 light years). The Milky Way is more than just the disk though, with a large, roughly-spherical distribution of older stars (and dark matter) around it known as\u00a0<a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/milkyway/components.html\">the galactic halo</a>. The size of this halo isn&#8217;t&#8230;well-defined. It&#8217;s got a lot of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster\">clusters of stars</a> though, so we can define its &#8220;edge&#8221; by where the overwhelming majority (90%) of these clusters are contained. This is about 100,000 light years away from the Sun. So, at the speed of light it&#8217;d take us about 1 year to escape the Sun, ~1,600 years to leave the thin disk, ~3,300 years to leave the thick disk, and 100,000 light years to reach the edge of the Milky Way. No human would survive any one of these trips (save for the trip out of the Solar System), not even\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah\">Methusaleh</a>.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Let&#8217;s get a little bit more practical, since as far as we know\u00a0<b>it&#8217;s impossible for anything with mass to reach light speed</b>. The effects of relativity start to become significant at about 40% light speed (specifically meaning that the kinetic energy of something moving at 40% light speed is 9% higher than it would be without relativity). So, moving constantly at 40% light speed from Earth, it&#8217;d take about 250,000 years for a spacecraft to reach the edge of the Milky Way.

What are some of the limitations of traveling at the speed of light?</h3>\n<div>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wriaJIWsVgM/VHwHeKdee0I/AAAAAAAAA58/KbeWUKgDIls/s1600/light_speed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"175\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Light Speeeeeeeeeed!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start this section by saying that, as far as we currently know,\u00a0<b>traveling at the speed of light is only possible for massless particles (like photons)</b>. This is all because of\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity\">relativity</a>, and the fact that the faster something moves, the more energy it takes to continue to accelerate that particle. This is especially apparent as you approach the speed of light, where &#8220;small&#8221; changes in velocity require near-infinite inputs of energy. Eventually you get to a point where the energy required to push that mass faster is laughably high, such that\u00a0<b>it might as well be infinite</b>.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure style=\"width: 237px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yVS22_TWjZo/VHwH1tekkRI/AAAAAAAAA6E/jq5622FR1Og/s1600/tons_tnt.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"237\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">1,750 tons TNT</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This is all very conceptual, so let&#8217;s have an example. I want to have a 1-gram cube of sugar move at 10% of light speed (with respect to my position on Earth). Without taking relativity into account, and assuming we&#8217;re not accelerating it up from rest, I just calculate the\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy\">kinetic energy</a>\u00a0(energy of an object in motion) of a 1-gram object moving at that speed. That kinetic energy happens to be about 450 billion Joules. For reference,\u00a0<b>that&#8217;s about the energy released in detonating one hundred and seven and a half tons of TNT.</b>\u00a0Now, let&#8217;s account for relativity. Relativity is special in that\u00a0<b>when a mass is moving, its velocity modifies its mass.</b>\u00a0Thus, instead of its kinetic energy being 450 billion Joules, its actually closer to 452.3 billion Joules. That doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but it is adding another half ton of TNT onto the pile. Not very impressive? Let&#8217;s see the difference at 99% of light speed.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>At 99% light speed, the kinetic energy of the 1-gram cube of sugar would be about 44.1 trillion Joules, or 10.5 kilotons (kilo = thousand) of TNT. Accounting for relativity we increase the mass by a factor of 7, and thus the energy by a factor of 7. Now we&#8217;re going from 10.5 kilotons to 74.7 kilotons of TNT in energy\u2014or about three and a half of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki in WW2. And as you get ever closer to the speed of light (99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, etc), the kinetic energy of that 1-gram cube of sugar also increases (240 kilotons TNT, 760 kilotons TNT, 2.4 million tons TNT, etc). It just keeps going up!</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Sx4piTmfP8/VHwIW_3hJ8I/AAAAAAAAA6M/kXrmgplT6r0/s1600/shuttle_atlantis.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The gorgeous space shuttle Atlantis</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s replace that 1-gram cube of sugar with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle\">2,030-ton space shuttle</a>. That means we need to scale up the energy requirement by a factor of 1.84 billion (hahahaha, just nonsense numbers here). This means that at 99% light speed, the kinetic energy of the shuttle would be about the same as about 19.4 billion <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent#Examples\">tons of TNT</a>. That&#8217;s more than twice the energy of the largest earthquakes ever recorded.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Now just for kicks, let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re able to bypass limitations of relativity and just accelerate a dude smoothly up to light speed. Perhaps we have a source of infinite energy. Who knows? Anyway, we accelerate a dude without a spacecraft up to light speed. What&#8217;s the limitations there? Well, keep in mind that what most of us consider to be Earth&#8217;s gravity is an acceleration that our body feels as its pulled toward the Earth&#8217;s surface. You experience something like gravity whenever you accelerate in any direction, like the feeling of going up in an elevator (before the speed evens out), or that first bit of liftoff when you&#8217;re in an airplane.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_Zo4IKymGg8/VHwJQTl8eHI/AAAAAAAAA6U/VJMmf1U3YHs/s1600/astronaut_gforce.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_Zo4IKymGg8/VHwJQTl8eHI/AAAAAAAAA6U/VJMmf1U3YHs/s1600/astronaut_gforce.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"295\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s turns out that\u00a0<a href=\"http://zidbits.com/2012/02/could-humans-colonize-a-planet-with-stronger-gravity/\">the human body has limitations\u00a0</a>on how much of that acceleration it can take, and that acceleration is measured in multiples of Earth&#8217;s gravity:\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force\">g-force</a>. We regularly experience 1g. Duh. The space shuttle would have pilots feeling 3g at maximum during liftoff and re-entry. \u00a0Remember, they undergo\u00a0<i>intense</i>\u00a0training to be able to handle that. If you undergo sustained acceleration at ~10g for more than a few minutes, you&#8217;re not walking away without serious damage. Hell, you&#8217;re <i>not</i> walking away. Let&#8217;s say for the sake of argument (again, ignoring relativity and practicality) that you accelerate constantly at 10g up to the speed of light. That would mean you&#8217;d have to be at a soul-destroying 10g\u00a0<u>constantly</u>\u00a0for 51,000 minutes, or a little over 35 days. You could, of course, just accelerate at 3g (which people can take, with difficulty) for 118 days, or 1g for a year, but where&#8217;s the fun in that?</p>\n<p>To sum up *some of* the limits of light speed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Humans can&#8217;t do it</li>\n<li>Accelerating near/up to it in reasonable timescales is really really uncomfortable</li>\n<li>Moving really fast requires truly insane amounts of energy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is just the first part of the question!

They&#8217;re menacing! They huge! They have some mysterious cosmic sucking power! I want to clear the air here about these magnificent, mysterious objects. Note, this isn&#8217;t going to be a comprehensive or exhaustive explanation about black holes. Just a little bit more information to clear a lot of the unknown.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with their basic nature. We talk about black holes in terms of mass because, technically, the actual objects actually have no size. Let&#8217;s separate two things: the <b>singularity</b>\u00a0is the actual collapsed object that has all the mass; the <b>event horizon </b>(the &#8220;black hole&#8221;) encompasses the region of space where light cannot escape. More on the latter in a bit.</p>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p>What do I mean by a &#8220;collapsed&#8221; object? To get that, we need to go back to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation\">gravity</a>\u00a0(which is, after all, <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution\">only\u00a0a theory</a></i>). The force of gravity is the attraction felt by any two objects that have mass (what we think of as weight). The bigger the mass of either object, the stronger the force of gravity. The larger the distance between them, the weaker the force. One way to think of it is like this: mass can be thought of as an amount that something likes to pull and be pulled. The more mass it has, the more it wants to pull and be pulled. However, the further away it is, the harder it is to actually pull. <b>Every</b> object is gravitationally attracted to <b>every</b> other object <b>everywhere</b> at <b>all times</b>. Me to my laptop (<a href=\"http://www.geekwithlaptop.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/technology-addiction.jpg\">more of an addiction</a> than an attraction), my phone to the floor, the Moon to my shoe, the Andromeda galaxy to the left wheel of your car\u2014as long as two objects have mass, they will be attracted to one another.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cOpMC72RSaE/VGJOEfTRH_I/AAAAAAAAA4o/lHY3hNqW-JU/s1600/singularity.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cOpMC72RSaE/VGJOEfTRH_I/AAAAAAAAA4o/lHY3hNqW-JU/s1600/singularity.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"229\" border=\"0\" /></a>In a star, all the mass in the star is feeling the force of gravity of itself, and is constantly trying to pull itself together. This is countered by the force from energy generated by nuclear fusion (<a href=\"http://rationalwhimsy.com/science-sunday-drop-that-stellar-beat-the-kappa-mechanism/\">discussed a bit here</a>). These two processes together act a lot <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWallsAreClosingIn\">like a hero trying to stop the walls from closing in on her</a>. If the star&#8217;s core stops producing energy (the hero&#8217;s strength fails), the star&#8217;s entire mass collapses toward the center (the walls crush her to death). This is what happens <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova#Core_collapse\">at the end of the life of a high-mass star</a>. If the star is massive enough, the attractive force of gravity of its collapsing core is stronger than any repulsion that could possibly stop it, and all that matter gets crushed together. Down from the size of a star to smaller than a planet. Smaller still\u2014smaller than an apple. Smaller than a penny! Smaller even than that little piece of dust floating through the air. Smaller than the smallest thing you can possibly imagine! In fact, it becomes so small that to give it a numerical physical size doesn&#8217;t even make sense anymore\u2014we describe it as being a singularity that&#8217;s &#8220;infinitesimal&#8221;. I think of it as a fast way of saying &#8220;infinitely small&#8221;.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p>Ok so the &#8220;black hole&#8221; part itself. Remember that the collapsed singularity retains all that mass from before. With objects that aren&#8217;t black holes but do have mass, there&#8217;s a certain speed (velocity) that you can travel to leave their gravitational pull (escape). It&#8217;s called the <b>escape velocity</b>\u00a0(we&#8217;re not creative people), and is a minimum speed limit controlled by the mass of the object and your distance from it.\u00a0As an example, I have about 80 kg of mass. And for simplicity&#8217;s sake, let&#8217;s crush me down to a sphere of radius 50 centimeters. If you&#8217;re standing right next to me, then to escape from <b>my</b> gravitational pull on <b>you</b> (note, your mass doesn&#8217;t matter), you&#8217;ve got to move at 0.00045 miles per hour. So, you know, <a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/61/02/de/6102debe7cf78ec19ad1f86dc17d0092.jpg\">you could just walk away</a>. To escape the Earth&#8217;s surface, you have to move at 25,000 mph (which is why we need rockets). Now, the fastest any object can move is the speed of light, 670 million mph. So, with black holes, we define the hole&#8217;s size (or event horizon) as the distance from that central mass out to where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. Within that distance, the escape velocity is higher than light speed, so <b>within the event horizon nothing can possibly escape</b>\u00a0(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation\">except for some extremely special circumstances</a>). Since not even light can escape from the event horizon, that region of space within the event horizon is black. It emits no light, and zero light is black. Again, astronomers are not creative people.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OEXHtlUoWLo/VGJM4KOZeyI/AAAAAAAAA4Y/TMH9HDo9JOQ/s1600/black-hole-milky-way.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OEXHtlUoWLo/VGJM4KOZeyI/AAAAAAAAA4Y/TMH9HDo9JOQ/s1600/black-hole-milky-way.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /></a>So with that, let&#8217;s dispel our first myth: the sizes of black holes. Even for supremely-massive singularities, the black holes are fairly small. A black hole with <b>the mass of the our Sun</b> would only have an event horizon <b>less than 3.7 miles in diameter. </b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*\">The supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy</a>\u00a0has a mass equal to about 4.5 million times our own Sun&#8217;s mass. It&#8217;s event horizon? About<i>at the center of our galaxy</i>\u00a0would fit within the\u00a0<i>smallest orbit in our Solar System</i>. Black holes are freakin&#8217; tiny.</p>\n<p>0.3 astronomical units (AU) in diameter. For reference, the planet Mercury orbits the Sun from about 0.3 AU away. So, the black hole part of the black hole</p>\n<p>Now, we&#8217;ve already established that once something enters within the event horizon, it&#8217;s (basically) gone forever. Many people get concerned that black holes suck up\u00a0everything they can\u00a0(<a href=\"http://www.physics.umaine.edu/ncomins/blackh_landingpage.html\">black holes don&#8217;t suck</a>), grow bigger, and eat even more. They imagine this exponentially growing beast that cannot be stopped! Let&#8217;s kill that right now. If you replaced the Sun with a black hole of the same mass, <b>nothing would change</b>. The planet&#8217;s orbit depends on three things: the mass of the planet, the mass of the thing they&#8217;re orbiting, and the distance between the two. <i>Not a single one of these things would change</i>. So, if the Sun&#8217;s not actively gobbling matter then neither would a black hole with the Sun&#8217;s mass. Even if it <i>were</i>\u00a0gobbling up matter, if it were to consume <b><u>all</u></b> of the matter within the Solar System (planets, moons, asteroids, and comets; 0.0001% of the Sun&#8217;s mass), its event horizon would only increase by 6 millimeters in diameter. Astronomically, that&#8217;s basically nothing.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YKAMfZMNrEs/VGJNuSYAXEI/AAAAAAAAA4g/eNyYIlzhvYw/s1600/gobble.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YKAMfZMNrEs/VGJNuSYAXEI/AAAAAAAAA4g/eNyYIlzhvYw/s1600/gobble.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"190\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>What about that demon at the Galaxy&#8217;s center? Well, it didn&#8217;t get to 4.5 million times the Sun&#8217;s mass for no reason\u2014it&#8217;s been quite busy gobbling stuff nearby. Still, it&#8217;s not just vacuuming up everything in the Galaxy. For that black hole to have the same pull on our Sun as the Sun has on the Earth, it&#8217;d have to be about 19.5 light years. Not only is the closest black hole discovered thus far <a href=\"http://blackholes.stardate.org/objects/type.php?p=stellar-mass\">about 3,000 light years away</a>, but we are over 24,000 light years from that supermassive black hole in our Galaxy&#8217;s center. Well beyond its influence.</p>\n<p>What IF a black hole was nearby? In fact, what if the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/19/large-hadron-collider-court_n_1989630.html\">insane worries of certain folk</a> were true and our recently-minted Large Hadron Collider produced its own black holes? Well, the LHC smashes two proton beams together in bunches at high fractions of the speed of light (&gt; 99%). They come in 2,808 bunches, with 115 billion protons per bunch, for a total of about 323 trillion protons. If something were to mash all these protons together into a singularity, their combined mass wouldn&#8217;t even equal 1% of one grain of salt. Its event horizon would be imperceptibly small (less than one trillionth of a trillionth of the radius of</p>\n<p>an electron), and if theory holds, it&#8217;d evaporate almost as soon as it was created. Even factoring the energy boost by moving near the speed of light (in general relativity, that increases the mass of an object by a ton), nothing changes.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RyQiffAgAtU/VGJO67EM1SI/AAAAAAAAA4w/67l5jhkuWfw/s1600/lhc_collision.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RyQiffAgAtU/VGJO67EM1SI/AAAAAAAAA4w/67l5jhkuWfw/s1600/lhc_collision.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rNYj5HBmhHY/VGJPX3Pb-9I/AAAAAAAAA48/ADTZdMA4Xds/s1600/blackholes_accretion.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rNYj5HBmhHY/VGJPX3Pb-9I/AAAAAAAAA48/ADTZdMA4Xds/s1600/blackholes_accretion.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"266\" border=\"0\" /></a>Lastly, I want to talk about observing black holes. Just because they don&#8217;t emit any light of their own doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re undetectable either by light or any other means. Swirling around many black holes, especially those in densely-packed areas, is an extremely hot disk of material called the <b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disc\">accretion disc</a></b>. &#8220;Accretion&#8221; is really just a fancier way of saying &#8220;collection&#8221;, so an accretion disk is just the disk of material collected by a black hole&#8217;s gravity (we&#8217;re gonna completely ignore any complications from magnetic fields). The material travels around the black hole looking like a frisbee with a hole in the center. Toward the very edge of the event horizon, the material is traveling extremely fast, but that speed drops off dramatically as you get toward the outer edge of the disk. It helps to think of the disk as a series of rings all touching each other and moving at different speeds. Because you have these rings of material with different speeds rubbing against each other, you get friction. And as you know if you&#8217;ve ever rubbed your hands against each other in the winter, a little bit of friction can generate a decent amount of heat. A lot of friction in the interior of the disk generates a ton of heat\u2014so much that the accretion disk not only glows in visible light and UV, but practically <i>screams</i>\u00a0in X-rays! So, when we look in the galaxy with our X-ray telescopes, we spot black holes (really black hole accretion disks) left and right.</p>\n<p>Goodness, I want to write more, I really do. But this has gone on pretty long already, so I&#8217;m going to wrap it up here. I&#8217;ll end this little discussion with this: the physical Universe is an intricate, at times subtle construct. It&#8217;s a place where both little things have huge consequences and massive things don&#8217;t change much at all.

We see our own Sun in the sky, and we really\u00a0only\u00a0see one small bright yellow disc. Look a little closer (never look directly at the Sun!), and you see its surface changing every 11 years. Sunspots grow and disappear, prominences arc wildly over its surface, flares spew out light, energy, and a cornucopia of charged particles into space, etc. And ours is just a run-of-the-mill Main Sequence star! What I want to talk about here is something that exhibits the dynamic side of evolved versions of stars like ours: stellar pulsation.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Now, while stars upon close examination are indeed dynamic objects, they do have a tendency to at least maintain their size. <a href=\"http://rationalwhimsy.com/science-sunday-the-stars-part-i-introduction-to-shiny-things/\">As has been discussed before</a>, all stars produce nuclear energy in their cores. This energy heats up the gas in the star, and provides the necessary gas pressure needed to hold the star up against the collapse of all its considerable mass. The more massive the star, the more energy needed to hold it up against the collapse of its fatness.\u00a0\u00a0If the star were to contract a small bit, the increased gravitational pressure would cause the core to produce more energy, thereby increasing the gas pressure, restoring it to its equilibrium state. This maintenance of shape by the interplay between gravitational collapse and gas pressure is called <b>hydrostatic equilibrium</b>. Be thankful for it. We&#8217;d never have had a chance to exist without it!</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2pQp2nWLz4o/VBTj71WA7eI/AAAAAAAAA1s/tbtv7FgXrNs/s1600/pulsation.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2pQp2nWLz4o/VBTj71WA7eI/AAAAAAAAA1s/tbtv7FgXrNs/s1600/pulsation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>So, what does hydrostatic equilibrium have to do with stellar pulsation (and in particular, the <b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_mechanism\">kappa mechanism</a></b>)? Well, all types of stellar pulsations occur when this equilibrium state is thrown out of whack. For massive thermal pulses, like those that occur in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_giant_branch\">the stars that I study for my thesis</a>, the star&#8217;s balanced state is disrupted by periodic changes in the type of fusion occurring in its core. However, I&#8217;ll save that little discussion for another post (if you really want the technical nitty gritty though, check out <a href=\"http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1983ARA%26A..21..271I\">this 1983 review paper by Icko Iben and Alvio Renzini</a> on AGB star evolution). For the shorter-term pulsations that I want to focus on here, the balance is ruined by changes in the type and properties of gas in the star.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5pVUo7ZOKYc/VBTkKXlmpzI/AAAAAAAAA10/kwCtaRu5A9Q/s1600/opacity.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5pVUo7ZOKYc/VBTkKXlmpzI/AAAAAAAAA10/kwCtaRu5A9Q/s1600/opacity.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"188\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>I want to take a brief little detour here and talk a little bit about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)\">opacity</a>. Opacity, denoted by the greek letter &#8220;kappa&#8221;, tells you how difficult it is for light to penetrate a substance. Something with a low opacity will let light pass through easily (like a window, dry air, or the vacuum of space). Opaque substances block most or all light from passing through (like a lamp shade, or a wall). When an opaque thing interacts with light, it&#8217;ll either scatter that light away, or absorb it.</p>\n<p>Right, so that&#8217;s opacity. In stars, the opacity of the gas in the star typically decreases as temperature and density of the gas increases. This means that as you move inward from the surface toward the stellar core, the gas becomes less and less opaque to light (as temperature and density increase as you get close to the core). \u00a0This also means that if the star contracts a little bit (increasing the temperature and density of the interior), the opacity of its atmosphere decreases and allows radiation to escape more easily, reaching the gas in that star&#8217;s atmosphere and restoring that equilibrium state. However, in stars that are unstable to opacity-driven pulsations, there exists a layer of gas (typically partially-ionized hydrogen or helium) in the stellar atmosphere whose opacity <i>increases</i>\u00a0as temperature and density increase. Thus, if the star were to contract a little, that layer would become <i>more</i>\u00a0opaque, and radiation would have an increasingly difficult time permeating the atmosphere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-57KyX0etniw/VBTkmeCDSDI/AAAAAAAAA18/ZyGGlh4qfGI/s1600/piston_engine.gif\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-57KyX0etniw/VBTkmeCDSDI/AAAAAAAAA18/ZyGGlh4qfGI/s1600/piston_engine.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a>Now here&#8217;s the kicker. If the star contracts, the gas in that opaque layer heats up. \u00a0When the gas heats up, it becomes ionized and that ionized form is more opaque than the non-ionized form. \u00a0The radiation is going into\u00a0fully <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization\">ionizing the gas</a> in that layer and heating up the gas below it, though not creating gas pressure IN that opaque layer to counteract gravity. So, the star continues to shrink until the buildup of radiative pressure below that opaque layer is just too much and the gas has reached maximum opacity. Then, just like a piston with heated gas beneath it, the cumulative radiative pressure forces the star&#8217;s atmosphere outward!</p>\n<p>The gas beneath that piston then cools, allowing the it to come back down to its rest state. Same thing happens in a star\u2014the buildup of radiative pressure gets released, the gas becomes cooler, less ionized, and less opaque, and so the star can contract again. \u00a0And thus we have the lub-dub of evolved stars. Radiative pressure builds beneath the opaque layer until it&#8217;s just too much and expands outward. The cooled gas (and thus lower gas pressure) allows the star&#8217;s atmosphere to contract and build its opacity back up. Then pump back out, and &#8220;relax&#8221; in.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 231px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OMDM0Jqg2-4/VBTljvivxJI/AAAAAAAAA2Q/k2afNLFmzmA/s1600/cepheid.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"231\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: <a href=\"http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~buchler/ceph/\">http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~buchler/ceph/</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>And I think that is damn cool.For some stars (Cepheid variables), this pulsation cycle can range between 1 to 100 days. For other stars (RR Lyrae), this pulsation can happen in under a day. These pulsations can change a star&#8217;s radius \u00a0by some ridiculous values (25% for some Cepheids!), and their brightnesses can just about double (RR Lyrae and Cepheids)! We know that the duration of the pulsation is linked to the average brightness of the star itself (called the period-luminosity relationship for variable stars. Thank <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt\">Henrietta Swan Leavitt</a> for that one). As such, we can use stars that show these variations to calculate distances and map things out in 3D space! Just from that beat, that little stellar instability, we can learn about the layout of our local Universe.</p>\n<p>-Peace</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">http://www.wikipedia.org<br />\n</a>The magic of Google<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.astronomynotes.com/starsun/s7.htm\">http://www.astronomynotes.com/starsun/s7.htm<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.space.com/15396-variable-stars.html\">http://www.space.com/15396-variable-stars.html<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~gk/A403/pulse.pdf\">http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~gk/A403/pulse.pdf</a></p>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-19T02:24:32", "date_gmt": "2014-09-13T02:20:56", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=216", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=216", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/216"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/216/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:featuredmedia": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/217", "embeddable": true}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=216", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=216"}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>One of the most fascinating things to me in our Universe is the fact that stars, these ridiculously massive, hot, bright objects that provide the necessary energy for existence as we know it, are not at all static objects.

Most of the music that I listen to is in that genre, and is pretty well restricted to the 1996-2003 era. During that time, the lyrical content of hip hop songs came under heavy fire. Parents and governmental agencies alike attacked the music and the culture for promoting violence, disrespect for authority, and particularly, profane language. \u00a0I remember those debates well, and I vividly remember not being allowed to listen to songs or certain radio stations because of their lyrical content.</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m somewhat older, questionably wiser, far more of an analyst, and am possessed with a similar level of curiosity for the world as I had when I heard my first Biggie track. I&#8217;ve played my favorite songs over and over again, chock full of the profanity that I missed as a kid, and I noticed that yeah, those songs are really, really not for kids. \u00a0But I could only feel that way one track at a time. \u00a0I get my 3 minutes and 30 seconds to make my judgement, then it&#8217;s on to the next (on-on to the next) one. \u00a0Quantitatively, however, I don&#8217;t really have a clue just how thick it is. \u00a0As such, I&#8217;ve decided to join two of my loves\u2014data analysis and hip hop culture\u2014and answer the following question: just how much vulgarity exists in the heights of hip hop?<!--more--></p>\n<figure style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ibx95nd5-8E/U5QC2HSm2BI/AAAAAAAAArw/Vw-HDj41VC4/s1600/albummosaic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">I got 99 albums&#8230;literally.

What this means is I totaled all the instances that particular word was used in every track in every album (that was available to me) that came out that year. For the N-word I included every possible variation I could manage. I wasn&#8217;t as diligent with the others (I added b&#8211;ch and b&#8211;ches together, but didn&#8217;t give enough damns to find more &#8220;f&#8211;k&#8221;s), but their close cousins don&#8217;t add much to their totals. The bottom graph is similar to the top one, but accounts for differences in album sales. Think of it as the word usage per album on average.</p>\n<p>So&#8230;wow. \u00a0I&#8217;d love to say something about the explosion of vulgarity in 1993 and how it&#8217;s been sustained over time, but that blue line is startling. What does this say? Best-selling rappers love saying the N-word. Obvious. Sure, the other ones have pretty bad frequencies too (does anyone really <i>need</i>\u00a0to say &#8220;b&#8211;ch&#8221; 40 times per album?), but nothing compares to the N-word. It&#8217;s no wonder why we&#8217;re often seen as that which the word describes\u2014we say it ALL THE DAMN TIME! Hell, it could be said that in order to make the top albums list, you need to pepper in as many n&#8211;gas as you can while still maintaining some degree of grammar (I&#8217;m looking at you, YG).

As a career scientist, it&#8217;s a habit of mine to qualify every statement that I make with a conditional; something to cover my ass if I turn out to be wrong. However, here I espouse my beliefs, and it is my sincere belief that everything about the world that is known can be known by anyone willing to put in the effort. I experience this on a regular basis with my forays into the Universe as an astronomer, and I&#8217;ve revisited this when I&#8217;ve set about learning new languages\u2014spoken or programming\u2014and new skills (physical or otherwise).</p>\n<div>\n<p>The fact of the matter is this: whether it&#8217;s language, or math, or finance, or dance, or microbiology, all spheres of human knowledge were discovered and fleshed out by human minds working with the raw material of the human brain. \u00a0And barring some developmental disorders, most brains at base have the same machinery. That means, at least to me, that if a human mind worked out the details of quantum electrodynamics, mine can as well. If a dance instructor created some choreography for me to learn, I can work at it and make that choreography my own. I can make art as great as the greats. I can build, I can learn, I can do. What it takes is the effort on my part to achieve.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>I feel like this is something that we forget as we venture further into adulthood, settling deeper into our own comfort zones. We get accustomed to being bad at things, and become unwilling to rectify that badness. For example, when faced with a complicated math problem,\u00a0many people will wear their inability to do math as a badge of honor. As a TA of 3 years I&#8217;ve encountered many versions of this. However, in reality it amounts to the same thing: you aren&#8217;t bad at math, you just haven&#8217;t made the effort to understand it. I make the same sort of statements with doing social things. &#8220;I&#8217;m not very sociable&#8221;, or &#8220;I&#8217;m bad at small talk&#8221;, or &#8220;I&#8217;ve never understood that way of existence.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>You may have had bad teachers of certain subjects, or bad experiences with certain realms of life, but the ability to understand and BE something that you&#8217;ve never been before lies within you. It&#8217;s the only way you&#8217;ve become the person you are today. You weren&#8217;t, as an infant, born into the world with the knowledge of how to turn an acid and a base into salt and water. \u00a0Humanity didn&#8217;t come pre-installed with knowledge of agriculture, pottery, architecture, electrical engineering, or relationship psychology. These are all things that have been learned and\u00a0developed by individuals with a thirst for growth; growth of themselves and of humanity.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>So don&#8217;t let your education end with your degree, or your career, or your thoughts about yourself. \u00a0Access your curiosity. Consume your ignorance and grow. Learn about life until you&#8217;re being lowered into your grave.

In order to begin to answer this question, I put on my &#8220;I Can Learn Anything with Google&#8221; hat and look briefly at what necessitated American slavery. The focus here is slavery in the U.S. and the colonies that would be come the U.S., <a href=\"http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/assessment/estimates.faces\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">where an estimated 253,000 slaves were shipped</a>. \u00a0Seeing as how American slavery (1619 &#8211; 1865) existed for longer than our nation has actually been a nation (246 years vs. 238 years), I&#8217;m going to do this in parts. \u00a0Let&#8217;s skip back to the early 1600s to examine Slavery &#8211; The Early Days. \u00a0Spoiler Alert: native Americans get hit first, and the life of an African was very, very cheap.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"separator\"><i>Note: My apologies to anyone that I may offend with my smart assery and occasional silliness. \u00a0This whole topic is a pot full of painful stuff and humor is how I cope. If you&#8217;re still reading, bear with me.</i><!--more--></p>\n<p class=\"separator\">The first permanent colony of what would become the United States was Jamestown, VA (British-owned), whose chief export was tobacco. \u00a0The great climate and demand for growing tobacco necessitated cheap labor, and options were limited: indentured British servants, native American slaves, and African slaves.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">Indentured servants were introduced by the Virginia Company to colonial America in 1619. \u00a0They were a combination of willing migrants, the religiously persecuted, criminals, and other undesirables. \u00a0In exchange for food, clothing, lodging, and a trip to the colonies, they worked for a fixed term (4-10 years) for no wages. \u00a0At the end, they&#8217;d be free to look for new jobs and a life in the colonies. They would also receive &#8220;freedom dues&#8221;, with some contracts including at least 25 acres of land, a year&#8217;s worth of corn, arms (&#8216;Murica), a cow, and new clothes (<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/indentured-servants-in-the-us/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">source</a>). There were even some blacks treated as indentured servants and given the same opportunities for freedom dues as whites. \u00a0This, however, didn&#8217;t work out in the long term (clearly). Why pay all that money for someone only\u00a0to\u00a0lose them in the end? Cut costs! Get workers that have no opportunity for freedom. You pay for them once, and never again. \u00a0Get slaves.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GQ5OoJKeNBw/UvCo-AC4tEI/AAAAAAAAAmw/7fNDdDarFG8/s1600/300px-Native_American_slaves.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"211\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Native Americans enslaved by Spaniards, 1596</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Different versions of slavery were present in the Americas before Europeans took it over (hell, it was present in Africa before Europe caught on, but we&#8217;re focusing on the U.S. of A). \u00a0Natives would enslave captives of war who they would use for small scale labor and ritual sacrifice. \u00a0The rights and privileges of these slaves varied widely between tribes. \u00a0Some were even able to marry widows. This all changed when the British began to colonize. \u00a0Being high on product and short on labor, British colonies were more than willing to buy the slaves from the local tribes. \u00a0Then they began instigate conflicts between tribes for more war slaves, and eventually stole from the tribes directly. \u00a0As an example, it&#8217;s estimated that between 30,000 to 50,000 natives were shipped out of Charleston, SC alone to the Caribbean between 1670 and 1715. I&#8217;d provide more numbers in this bit, but the records are spotty at best.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">The enslavement of natives didn&#8217;t work out so well for the fledgeling colonies. \u00a0Don&#8217;t get me wrong here, it still happened. \u00a0Huge swaths of native American communities were devastated by the capture and sale of their people throughout the history of American slavery. \u00a0Many were traded to work in West Indian sugarcane plantations when the sugar market boomed. \u00a0However, the enslavement of natives proved costly in money and lives. Although several tribes were complicit in the enslavement of rival tribes, toward the mid 1700&#8217;s they began to band together to resist their enslavement. \u00a0Also, as time went on from the 1600s to the 1700s, African slaves became more readily available.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xe4yg1UVURo/UvCn7FtWY0I/AAAAAAAAAmk/utjUrpQjmXA/s1600/slaveauction2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"194\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A sample slave auction; Richmond, VA</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While the first sets of Africans were brought to Virginia in 1619, the first sets of African <b><i>slaves</i></b> were brought into present-day New York City (NYC represent!) in 1625 by the Dutch West India Company. Although enslaved, Africans had a few basic rights and families were preserved. Their children could be baptized, they could testify in court, sign legal documents, and even *gasp* bring civil actions against whites. \u00a0Some were permitted to work after hours, earning wages equal to those paid to white workers.</p>\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>In 1662, Virginia decreed that children born in VA &#8220;shall be bond or free according to the condition of the mother&#8221;, thereby allowing plantation owners the right to enslave their illegitimate mixed-race children, removing their responsibility to acknowledge, support, or emancipate these children. \u00a0Along with that, &#8220;free&#8221; white women would be penalized for sex with slaves by serving that slave&#8217;s master for life, preserving the property rights of slaveowners. By 1664, the colonies all passed laws mandating lifelong servitude for all black slaves. \u00a0During the late 1600s, British indentured servitude declined, and planters became increasingly concerned about creating a large class of restless, landless, poor white men (former indentured servants). Wealthy VA and MD planters bought slaves in preference to indentured servants, and eventually poorer planters followed suit. \u00a0By the end of the 1600s, a planter could buy an African slave for life for the same price that he could purchase a white indentured servant for 10 years.</p>\n<p>Consider the economic choice between a white indentured servant with a term of 4 years and a slave. Figures here will be an irresponsible combo of <a href=\"http://www.virtualjamestown.org/documents1.html\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">these indentured servant contracts</a>. \u00a0Let&#8217;s take young William Buckland&#8217;s 1755 salary of \u00a320 sterling per year for 4 years (80 pounds total) and <a href=\"http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">scale that back to the 1627 economy</a>. \u00a0That&#8217;s an average \u00a313.7 per year in 1627, totaling \u00a354.8. \u00a0For reference, \u00a354.8 pounds in the 1627 economy scales up to \u00a3135,000 in 2012, or about $220,000 American. \u00a0At roughly $55,000 per year, PLUS food, housing, clothes, and job prospects at the end if their terms, they&#8217;re looking like a mighty better deal than an astronomy grad student. \u00a0But I digress. \u00a0Atop the \u00a354.8 salary, housing, food, and clothes for 4 years, there&#8217;s the cost of the voyage (\u00a35, about $20,000 today), and the freedom dues of 25 acres of land, a year&#8217;s worth of corn, arms (&#8216;Murica), and a cow. If we devalue all the freedom dues, a 4 year servant still cost roughly $250,000 in today&#8217;s dollars.</p>\n<p>Contrast that with the average slave cost of \u00a320 in the 1600s (very rough estimate based on <a href=\"http://discoveringbristol.org.uk/slavery/routes/from-africa-to-america/tradeing-africa/value-of-trade/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">this</a>). Let&#8217;s assume that slaves came in at about&#8230;24 years of age, and lived to the average life colonial life expectancy of 44 \u2013 that&#8217;s 20 years of service. \u00a0So, for the total cost of an indentured servant, you could buy roughly 3 slaves that would work <i>FOR LIFE</i>. \u00a0In addition, you are guaranteed ownership of their offspring. \u00a0If each slave had only one kid, you then had 3 new slaves for 40 years. \u00a0Considering only two generations in this model, the price of one indentured servant (\u00a360) got you 6 slaves and a combined 180 years of service. Your costs reduce from \u00a315 per year to ~\u00a30.3 per year; a 98% reduction of cost. Slavery: the ultimate capitalist model.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"separator\">In 1676 Bacon&#8217;s Rebellion hit Virginia like a molotov cocktail, in that the capital was bathed in fire and literally burned to the ground. Discontented frontiersmen and frequent attacks from natives caused the white underclass to ally with Africans against bond-servitude and revolt, demanding the colonial government seize native American land for distribution, amongst other things. They held the rebellion for 8 months before the British royal army suppressed it. This unity amongst the underclass alarmed the ruling class, and in response racial lines drawn by slavery were brought to the fore and solidified into law and common rhetoric.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">From here it turns darker for a while. \u00a0But there&#8217;s sunshine on the horizon. \u00a0Have to first remember the struggle before we celebrate the triumphs. \u00a0Cheers.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">References:</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2012/08/24/caribbean-project-the-proto-south/\">http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2012/08/24/caribbean-project-the-proto-south/<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_colonial_United_States\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_colonial_United_States<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.landofthebrave.info/indentured-servants.htm\">http://www.landofthebrave.info/indentured-servants.htm<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.landofthebrave.info/slave-plantations.htm\">http://www.landofthebrave.info/slave-plantations.htm<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040804001522/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_indians_slavery.htm\">http://web.archive.org/web/20040804001522/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_indians_slavery.htm<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/useful/pdf/indian_slavery.pdf\">http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/useful/pdf/indian_slavery.pdf<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.isreview.org/issues/26/roots_of_racism.shtml\">http://www.isreview.org/issues/26/roots_of_racism.shtml<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/timeline/1662.html\">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/timeline/1662.html<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://library.thinkquest.org/3337/time16.html\">http://library.thinkquest.org/3337/time16.html<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/indentured-servants-in-the-us/\">http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/indentured-servants-in-the-us/<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/jamestown-browse?id=J1046\">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/jamestown-browse?id=J1046<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/\">http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://journeytohistory.com/history101/articles/Colonists%20in%20Bondage.pdf\">http://journeytohistory.com/history101/articles/Colonists%20in%20Bondage.pdf<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://discoveringbristol.org.uk/slavery/routes/from-africa-to-america/tradeing-africa/value-of-trade/\">http://discoveringbristol.org.uk/slavery/routes/from-africa-to-america/tradeing-africa/value-of-trade/</a></p>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-19T02:12:41", "date_gmt": "2014-02-04T02:09:02", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=202", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=202", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/202"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/202/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:featuredmedia": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/203", "embeddable": true}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=202", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=202"}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>We&#8217;ve looked at the slave ships that brought Africans to the New World, but what were they brought here for?

Remember as you read what follows that this is an approximation, where our slave ship is a paper-thin box. \u00a0Consider the average adult to be 5.7 feet tall and 1.6 feet wide, and stack them as tightly as you can in a paper-thin box that&#8217;s 101.7 feet long and 29.9 feet wide.

One account of a captured vessel&#8217;s &#8220;cargo&#8221; counts 562 slaves, 55 of which had been thrown overboard. \u00a0Another has slaves numbering in the 800&#8217;s for a vessel regulated for 350.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oN4S2w8n4Fk/UvAV7iq6fvI/AAAAAAAAAlc/f1C3jonigpU/s1600/slaveship2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"122\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vertical cross-section of typical slave ships</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Voyages along the middle passage could last from one to three months, during which time many of the enslaved would die from disease, suicide (jumping overboard or other means), malnourishment, and just plain violence.</p>\n<p>Over 35,000 voyages were made to transport slaves to the Americas. \u00a0If you consider an arbitrary figure of 400 slaves taken per voyage, that results in at about 14 million slaves legally transported to the Americas between 1527 and 1808 (when the abolition of the international slave trade took effect in the United States; legal domestic slavery lasted until 1865 with the 13th amendment). \u00a0It&#8217;s actually estimated that the number is closer to 20 million slaves. \u00a0Bringing our average up to roughly 570 slaves per voyage. \u00a0The mortality rate for the voyage alone was about 15%, making the trip to the western hemisphere responsible for a genocide of Africans closing in on numbers put up by the Holocaust.</p>\n<p>Cheers, everyone.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slaveship.htm\">http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slaveship.htm<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/topic.cfm?migration=1&amp;topic=5\">http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/topic.cfm?migration=1&amp;topic=5<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://theslaveship.clevelandhistory.org/the-ship-2/\">http://theslaveship.clevelandhistory.org/the-ship-2/<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_ship\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_ship<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duc_du_Maine_(slave_ship)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duc_du_Maine_(slave_ship)<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.ageofsail.net/aoshipty.asp\">http://www.ageofsail.net/aoshipty.asp<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html\">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html<br />\n</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Passage\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Passage</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-19T02:08:07", "date_gmt": "2014-02-03T02:04:17", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=199", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=199", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/199"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/199/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:featuredmedia": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/200", "embeddable": true}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=199", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=199"}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>Slavery was a horrid and sad era in American history. \u00a0Even though it&#8217;s an ugly and depressing thing to dwell on, appreciation for what our people have become today starts with the recognition of what got us here. \u00a0So, we start with what literally got us here: the Slave Ship.</p>\n"}, "categories": [1], "tags": [71, 66, 72], "guid": {"rendered": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/?p=199"}, "id": 199, "title": {"rendered": "Black History Month 2014: The Anatomy of a Slave Ship"}, "comment_status": "open", "author": 1, "modified_gmt": "2015-09-19T02:08:07", "meta": [], "sticky": false, "slug": "black-history-month-2014-the-anatomy-of-a-slave-ship", "template": "", "ping_status": "open"}, {"featured_media": 195, "format": "standard", "type": "post", "link": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/long-term-investing-how-much-growth-is-there-really/", "date": "2014-02-01T02:01:08", "content": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uBJtmvdyfm0/Uu0Wgq2j_sI/AAAAAAAAAko/NOiARXPIIZE/s1600/invest-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uBJtmvdyfm0/Uu0Wgq2j_sI/AAAAAAAAAko/NOiARXPIIZE/s1600/invest-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"213\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is going to be one of my shorter posts&#8230;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been really interested in money lately. \u00a0Namely, how to keep it from flowing forth from my pockets, and even how to make it grow on its own. \u00a0This, along with discussions of money amongst other grad students in my department, led me to create a PowerPoint presentation (available after next month) giving a basic overview of things like budgeting, debt, and investing.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Now, when talking about investing with those that have invested, I&#8217;ve tended to have the feeling of it being this mystical world where money goes in and dice are rolled.

I ask these questions and, in what follows, hope that I have found the beginnings of an answer. \u00a0As always, please chime in on the comments (or contact me by other means) if you have an opinion. \u00a0Twenty-seven years of life as a Black American doesn&#8217;t qualify me as some supreme expert on the subject, and I welcome all feedback; anything that makes me think is worth considering.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<div>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nhYpMJU1wDY/UioQS13g1eI/AAAAAAAAAgA/5-Dj3P8manY/s1600/whoami.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nhYpMJU1wDY/UioQS13g1eI/AAAAAAAAAgA/5-Dj3P8manY/s320/whoami.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Starting broadly, I think that being a Black American means that your ancestry is traceable back to any one of the millions of slaves that inhabited this country. Whether you can actually trace it back yourself is irrelevant. Whether your skin color shows your heritage or not is also irrelevant, though it does make it harder for you to assert your &#8220;blackness&#8221; where applicable. \u00a0If you share blood with one of those that was enslaved here in the United States, you&#8217;re a Black American. \u00a0That means, to me, that Black Canadians, Caribbeans, Central Americans, and South Americans that come to the United States are not Black Americans. They&#8217;re still Black, as they share that same slave descent, but they&#8217;re not Black Americans. That also means that, again to me, Africans (immigrant and otherwise) are not Black\u2014 they&#8217;re African (and since Africa is <b>not </b>a country, they&#8217;re Nigerian, Ethiopian, Egyptian, Moroccan, Senegalese, etc). \u00a0 This is not to say that being a Black American is any better (or worse) than being Black Dominican, Black Brazilian, or Congolese; it&#8217;s simply just not the same category.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lz1tmqMjtpE/UioOOly_LuI/AAAAAAAAAfg/rEIiuqrOS_U/s1600/Slave_Auction_Ad.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lz1tmqMjtpE/UioOOly_LuI/AAAAAAAAAfg/rEIiuqrOS_U/s320/Slave_Auction_Ad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"218\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>That said, I think that the essence of &#8220;Blackness&#8221;, whether you&#8217;re in America or not, lies in that shared history of pain coming from slavery. \u00a0That&#8217;s the common thread that binds all of us lost children in the Western Hemisphere. \u00a0We&#8217;re lost because much of our history has been scrambled and/or lost by the slave trade, so much so that we might as well have sprouted randomly from American soil. \u00a0Our ancestors lost their music, their gods, their dances, their food, their names\u2014their identities were lost in the beatings, the killings, and the suicides that characterized those difficult times. \u00a0In this oppressive alien land, Blacks as a people have had to reboot their culture from the ground up. \u00a0Thus, when I think on Black Pride and try to define it in my own mind, this is where I start. \u00a0I hesitate to use &#8220;African American&#8221;, for these very reasons. \u00a0Yes, we&#8217;re of African descent and we never can nor should we ever deny that. \u00a0However, we&#8217;re so disconnected from that root that to call ourselves African-Americans similar to the way in which others refer to themselves as Chinese-Americans, Indian-Americans, and Norwegian-Americans is disingenuous, as it pertains to our actual connection to anything in Africa. \u00a0There is no &#8220;old country&#8221; for us. \u00a0Our pre-slavery history is black as our skin (ooh wee, that was clever! Wasn&#8217;t that clever? \u00a0I thought that was clever.).</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>Black Pride means first acknowledging and owning that slave ancestry, and very simply being proud that you managed to come out of that. It means remembering their struggle and honoring the values that they fought for. It means keeping in mind that, above all else, our forebears bled, suffered, and died for <b>the opportunity to choose who we wanted to be</b>, and be acknowledged as human. It means honoring our skin color, our typical common tracer (though not always obvious, as my own grandmother could&#8217;ve passed for a tanned white lady), and the rainbow of shades in which we can appear.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iMjrhWEbas8/UioO_xhvBtI/AAAAAAAAAf0/W_4pu7eEMok/s1600/hairstyles.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iMjrhWEbas8/UioO_xhvBtI/AAAAAAAAAf0/W_4pu7eEMok/s400/hairstyles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"282\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>It means being proud of our hair in its natural state, in the bouquet of different curls in which it can come.

The reason for a style is as important as, if not more than, the style itself. If you relax or otherwise disguise/alter the nature of your hair, know that women and men use to do it because our hair was thought of as disgusting and deplorable in its natural state. Know that women and men burned themselves with lye and hot combs in order to get hair that looked &#8220;white&#8221;. Know that &#8220;goodness&#8221; of one&#8217;s hair is still a raw wound amongst people of color. \u00a0And if you&#8217;re on the flip side of that and are judging those with hair appearing different than yours, cut that nonsense and know that everyone has different preferences and may not be the &#8220;lost child&#8221; that you think they are. \u00a0Check yourself accordingly, then move on with your life knowing that the style you choose is the style YOU choose that makes you happy, and not the product of any residual self hate or a misguided need to rebel.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1xJWSRei59s/UioRDZa1BeI/AAAAAAAAAgM/2WGQ9zHv6zQ/s1600/dance.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1xJWSRei59s/UioRDZa1BeI/AAAAAAAAAgM/2WGQ9zHv6zQ/s320/dance.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"209\" border=\"0\" /></a>It means honoring others like us that share our history and working to bring them up in ways that respect their individual struggles, as they&#8217;re the descendants of our own ancestors&#8217; partners in struggle. It means honoring the music our people make, the steps that our people take when they dance, and calling out either one when they dishonor us. It also means honoring the fact that we are of African origin, and paying homage to the cultures that have sprouted up and lived there over time, though I caution against generic African reverence because it carries a similar ignorance of the individual peoples of Africa that is shared by those that have oppressed those people.</p>\n<p>Black pride means honoring our food and cooking styles, while taking strides to find healthier alternatives to classic &#8220;soul food&#8221; which will annihilate your body over time. \u00a0It means honoring our bodies and all of the different ways in which they can appear. \u00a0Because of centuries of selective breeding, convolved with basic characteristics of our African ancestry and some mixture of native American and European (from both legitimate and illegitimate relationships), our body types follow certain trends. \u00a0Honor your musculature, your curves, and your other physical characteristics, but also honor your health. \u00a0Don&#8217;t write off poor (or nonexistent) eating and exercise habits. \u00a0There&#8217;s a big difference between a genetic big butt and a McDonald&#8217;s big butt. \u00a0Own it.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--gbCZEMDqbM/UioSBEMNi3I/AAAAAAAAAgU/WVuN6iAKy3E/s200/Black_Jesus_2990.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bet you didn&#8217;t know Black Jesus had dreads! Haha!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It means honoring Black religious practices, whether you believe or don&#8217;t (like myself). That in particular means not only revering your Muhammad or Black Jesus, but respecting practitioners of Vodou, Candombl\u00e9, Santeria, and other religions that have sprouted from Black mouths and minds, as well as respecting those who have chosen not to subscribe to a religion. You don&#8217;t have to believe the way that someone else does to pay respect.</p>\n<p>It also means honoring the style with which we speak, and not denigrating the slang that comes out of our neighborhoods just because it&#8217;s different from the &#8220;proper English&#8221; that we&#8217;ve all learned. It&#8217;s its own English dialect and should be viewed as such, and not looked down upon simply because it has grown out of the ghettos. It should also be allowed to be analyzed and critiqued like any other dialect, especially when parts of it put prison, pimp, and drug culture on a pedestal. The same goes for our fashion.</p>\n<p>To me, Black Pride means all of these things and more, much of which I&#8217;m still fleshing out for myself. At the last, Black Pride means honoring yourself because you are who you are, and not dishonoring other cultures because they&#8217;re different, or because individuals in those cultures resemble (and let&#8217;s face it, sometimes actively emulate) those that once beat, raped, swindled, and lynched our ancestors. Acknowledge the pain, the anger, and the resentment, but don&#8217;t transfer it to those who exist today. Unless they deserve it.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;\"></div>\n<div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;\">\n<p><i>I apologize in advance if I rambled a little.

all water that springs from the earth and has yet to reach\u00a0the ocean, the realm of <a href=\"http://rationalwhimsy.com/orishas-yemanja/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Yemanj\u00e1</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"separator\">\nAs the rivers do for the people that use them, Oxum nurtures and purifies. \u00a0She provides food by way of the fish that swim with her, clean drinkable water for the thirsty, the source for growth via the irrigation of nearby plants, and waters within which you can cleanse yourself. \u00a0As such, she&#8217;s also associated with maternity, fertility, femininity, vitality, and purification/healing.<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yyo-_zVcnHs/UhoUFJis4xI/AAAAAAAAAb4/gJfICncniRc/s1600/oxumart2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yyo-_zVcnHs/UhoUFJis4xI/AAAAAAAAAb4/gJfICncniRc/s320/oxumart2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"256\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Expanding more into the feminine qualities, she, like <a href=\"http://rationalwhimsy.com/orishas-yemanja/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Yemanj\u00e1</a> and other female orix\u00e1s, represents not the entirety of the feminine psyche, but specific parts. \u00a0Her demeanor is loving, caring, nurturing, and seldom ever angry. \u00a0She is the sweetness in sweet women; the very personification of the &#8220;sweet princess&#8221; concept. \u00a0At times, she is even somewhat coquettish, and there are many stories about her seduction of several of the male orix\u00e1s. However, while sweet, she is not eternally docile. \u00a0Like the rivers in a violent storm, when she loses her temper, she can be widely and indiscriminately destructive. \u00a0By no means is she na\u00efve; her wisdom and counsel often being sought by men and women.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lKAo1Wj83NE/UhoZWXNjvFI/AAAAAAAAAcM/YAegK7f6D3U/s1600/oxumart3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lKAo1Wj83NE/UhoZWXNjvFI/AAAAAAAAAcM/YAegK7f6D3U/s320/oxumart3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"226\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>She is also, in a word, beautiful. \u00a0Now, typically the female orix\u00e1s are all described as beautiful, so to simply describe her as such does her no justice. \u00a0She is not just beautiful; she is beauty. \u00a0Because beauty is her quality, she&#8217;s often depicted holding a mirror (the symbolic item of beauty), and in provocative clothing (if there&#8217;s any clothing at all). \u00a0In the same way that she is beauty personified, she embodies female sexuality. \u00a0As such, children of Oxum (women AND men that Oxum chooses to share her spirit with; &#8220;possess&#8221; only describes half of the process) are to be stunningly beautiful and are always the subject of attraction. \u00a0Though beautiful, they are by no means dumb; I cannot stress this enough. \u00a0They appreciate luxury and sex, they are vain, elegant, sensuous, and like changes, at times resulting in infidelity. \u00a0But, they are calm, tranquil, emotional, and cry easily. \u00a0They are smart, managing to get everything they want through imagination and plot. \u00a0Though complacent and prodigal, they can be self-seeking, lazy, and hesitant. \u00a0They are very suspicious, and have a great intuition which is often put to work for artfulness (plagiarized mostly from <a href=\"http://tranceform.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=40%3Acandomble-a-psychological-types&amp;catid=20%3Amember-article&amp;Itemid=89&amp;lang=en\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">here</a>). \u00a0Oxum&#8217;s children also favor bright colors, music, dance, and excitement.</p>\n<p>Her dominion over fertility should not go without mention. \u00a0As the orix\u00e1 of fertility, she protects all pregnancies. \u00a0Interestingly enough, while she herself loves to become pregnant, she is not inclined to raise her children, having a tendency to pawn them off to her siblings (terrible!). \u00a0But yeah, as much as women in Brazil may pray to Oxum to find their luck in love, they will also look to her for protection in their pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Oxum is one of the children of Oxal\u00e1 (the male orix\u00e1 of purity, light, and creation) and, as one might expect, Yemanj\u00e1 (the &#8220;All-Mother&#8221; if you will, and orix\u00e1 of the oceans), and the most loved of those children. \u00a0She was at a time one of the wives of Xango (warrior orix\u00e1 of fire, thunder, justice, and male power/sexuality), taking him from his original wife Ians\u00e1 (orix\u00e1 of winds, hurricanes, change, and gates of the underworld), but as is her nature, she floated in and out of that relationship, has been a lover of Ogun (<span style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;\">warrior orix\u00e1 of iron, war, labour, sacrifice</span>), Orunmil\u00e1 (orix\u00e1 of wisdom, knowledge, and divination), and seducer of Exu (orix\u00e1 of many things, not least of which are trickery and messages between orix\u00e1 and man). \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.juntosnocandomble.com.br/2008/11/oxum.html\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">One myth I&#8217;ve found</a> (and likely poorly translated and interpreted) goes as follows: Oxum was always extremely curious and passionate for an orix\u00e1. \u00a0She had wanted her father&#8217;s best friend, the orix\u00e1 Orunmil\u00e1, to teach her how to see the future. \u00a0This secret was the domain of the Olu\u00f4/Awo (essentially Orunmil\u00e1&#8217;s priest), a position that could not be held by a woman. \u00a0Determined to learn divination, she tried to seduce the information from him, but Orunmil\u00e1, already old and beyond her seductive abilities, refused to teach her.</p>\n<p>Not to be deterred by this minor setback, Oxum set about trying to find other ways to learn this secret. \u00a0She turned to seduce Exu, who couldn&#8217;t resist being enchanted by her beauty. \u00a0She ordered him to steal Orunmil\u00e1&#8217;s ikin. \u00a0For reference, the ikin (consecrated palm nuts)\u00a0are generally used for divine protection, and special four-eyed ikin are used for divination. \u00a0Having managed to steal Orunmil\u00e1&#8217;s ikin, Exu gave them to Oxum. \u00a0As such Orunmil\u00e1 was forced to share with Oxum the secrets of fortune-telling and handed her the sixteen cowrie shells that she has used for divination ever since. \u00a0Wow, that was confusing. \u00a0Long story short: \u00a0She wanted Orunmil\u00e1 to teach her to see the future, but he refused. \u00a0She seduced Exu and made him steal the Orunmil\u00e1&#8217;s fortune-telling ikin, and once she had them, Orunmil\u00e1 was like &#8220;screw it, here&#8217;s the secrets.&#8221; \u00a0This shows Oxum willing to get what she wants by any means necessary.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-utEvgXKIvT0/UhpkMPIE8GI/AAAAAAAAAck/1l4Gsl_nYug/s1600/oxumart5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-utEvgXKIvT0/UhpkMPIE8GI/AAAAAAAAAck/1l4Gsl_nYug/s320/oxumart5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"213\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Like the other orix\u00e1s, there is a ceremonial dance associated with the celebration of Oxum (what follows about the dancing was mostly plagiarized from <a href=\"http://juicyr.blogspot.com/2009/05/oxum-orisha-of-love.html\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">here</a>). \u00a0Oxum usually starts her dance slowly with hand motions. \u00a0She is usually dancing in the middle of the floor, her feet positioned closely together as it was said that she lived in the river like a mermaid. \u00a0Thus, she has no real foot choreography. \u00a0She makes small dance steps and she usually slides across the floor, rather than steps. \u00a0Her lack of dance steps makes us focus more on her arm movements, as well as her chest, neck, and stomach. \u00a0Her dance is very complicated because the sternum must be in command, since Oxum lives in the waters. \u00a0The hands should always be at the side of the body with palms up. \u00a0The body is required that the shoulders do slight contradictions up as the elbows move away from the body and down as they close in. \u00a0She dances with grace and she constantly drops to the floor to collect water. \u00a0Oxum&#8217;s arms go up and she slides her tail. \u00a0She uses her mirror, as well as her lipstick, rouge, and her comb.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-psr7gbzd7Ao/UhpvdiEtBwI/AAAAAAAAAc0/AqkCtPa-PmI/s1600/oxumart6.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-psr7gbzd7Ao/UhpvdiEtBwI/AAAAAAAAAc0/AqkCtPa-PmI/s200/oxumart6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading this far and have been paying attention the entire time, you&#8217;ll notice something of a constant with representations of Oxum. \u00a0She&#8217;s always depicted wearing yellow and gold, or when her clothes are few, possessing items of yellow/gold. \u00a0Yellow is her color, and gold is her metal. \u00a0As she represents beauty in its purest form, she keeps beauty about her in the form of gold and precious items. \u00a0Looking across cultures, she&#8217;s worshipped in many essentially parallel religions, and they each have small differences in how they worship. \u00a0It&#8217;s thus difficult to pin down her Feast Day. \u00a0However, regardless of location, it appears to occur sometime around the second week of September (though there is a mention of a date in December). \u00a0It is then, as well as whenever else she is worshipped, that followers will offer such things as honey, pumpkin, white wine, rum, cakes, jewelry, and hens.</p>\n<p>I think that this is probably about enough to get a decent picture of this orix\u00e1. \u00a0Let&#8217;s end as we did before, with some more artwork pertaining to Oxum. \u00a0I wanted to put up some videos of songs pertaining to Oxum, but they&#8217;re not showing up here so, bleh. Ora i\u00e9i\u00e9 Oxum!</p>\n<p>======= Learning stops here. \u00a0Now it&#8217;s just artwork =======</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a

relatively short one. \u00a0The other day, this question popped into my mind: Why is it that when things burn, they turn black? \u00a0Physically, what exactly happens when something is being burned that causes that blackness to be left behind, and what is that blackness? \u00a0The answer that made the most sense to me at first thought was that the blackness that was left behind was probably some form of carbon. \u00a0Firstly, materials of pure carbon tend to appear blackish (e.g. graphite), except when their atomic bonds are arranged in the tetrahedra that create diamonds.</p>\n<p><!--more--><br />\nSecondly, organic matter (the type of stuff that tends to burn anyway, and which comprises much of what is on the surface of the Earth aside from air and water) is choc full of carbon, which tends to be bound to a bunch of other elements (your hydrogens, nitrogens, oxygens, etc.). When whatever compound that carbon is a part of heats up, what probably happens is that energy input into that compound goes into breaking the bonds between carbon and other elements, and the other elements vaporize while carbon creates new bonds with itself (and other oxygen atoms creating CO and CO2; carbon is really quite good at bonding with other elements). \u00a0The hydrogen that&#8217;s bound to the carbon links up with the oxygen that&#8217;s being liberated and creates water, etc. \u00a0I only took introductory chemistry, so my knowledge of such things is limited.</p>\n<p>Thus was my initial speculation. \u00a0Following what I&#8217;d always grown up being told to do, I looked it up. \u00a0Luckily, such questions are easily answered by Google.</p>\n<p>What we think of as &#8220;burning&#8221; is really the rapid oxidation of organic molecules. \u00a0When organic molecules are oxidized, they combine with oxygen in the air and produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy (in the form of heat, light, and sound).</p>\n<table class=\"tr-caption-container\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-z48WdvhLBbQ/UcXljQN_VHI/AAAAAAAAAYw/2va4XEBtsRU/s1600/combustionrxn.gif\"><img src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-z48WdvhLBbQ/UcXljQN_VHI/AAAAAAAAAYw/2va4XEBtsRU/s320/combustionrxn.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"152\" border=\"0\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tr-caption\"><i>Propane combustion, as an example.</i></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For things like wood, you have this combustion reaction. \u00a0The energy that&#8217;s released comes out in the form of fire and what&#8217;s left behind is more or less a carbon skeleton (alongside other inorganic compounds and whatever material wasn&#8217;t oxidized). \u00a0Bing bam boom, simple answer for a simple question.</p>\n<p>Looking at this, another question comes to mind: Oxygen comprises 20.95% of dry air by volume. \u00a0Even at this small fraction, we&#8217;re effectively large, fleshy bags of organic matter, walking through veritable fields of oxygen all the time. \u00a0If oxidation happens when objects combine with oxygen, and oxidation is highly exothermic (heat producing), why is it that organic compounds like trees, houses, and hell, PEOPLE, aren&#8217;t just on fire all the time?</p>\n<table class=\"tr-caption-container\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kxfa7nLqwKI/UcXogw8DnEI/AAAAAAAAAZA/7DGww-yiIr0/s1600/burningearth.jpg\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kxfa7nLqwKI/UcXogw8DnEI/AAAAAAAAAZA/7DGww-yiIr0/s320/burningearth.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tr-caption\"><i>OH MY GOD WHY?!?</i></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Turns out that organic combustion is temperature-dependent. \u00a0There&#8217;s some lower threshold beneath which something will not burn (at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure) called the activation energy. \u00a0Once a substance reaches this temperature, if it is in the presence of a sufficient amount of oxygen, it will then have the energy necessary to sprout flames without an external heat source. \u00a0Thus, your skin is just fine and safe. \u00a0Try not to walk through any fires, though. \u00a0I can&#8217;t guarantee your safety there.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s it!

\u00a0One of nature&#8217;s many spectacular light shows! I learned a little bit about electric discharges in college-level Electricity and Magnetism, with a brief mention as to how lightning works. \u00a0However, since I never took any atmospheric science, I never got an in-depth look at it. \u00a0Let&#8217;s get into it RIGHT NOW! \u00a0Note, there is going to be a bit of physics jargon in this post, but I promise to keep it light. \u00a0Cross my heart, hope to die, stick a needle in my eye.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Lighting in its essence is the large-scale version of a small spark emitted from a faulty wire: an electrostatic discharge. \u00a0Why does this discharge occur? \u00a0Well, to understand that, we have to take another look at electric charges (first one was <a href=\"http://rationalwhimsy.com/science-sunday-light-you-magnificent-bastard/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">here</a>). \u00a0Charged particles, such as electrons, generally tend to move away from areas with very high concentrations of like-charges (highly negative) to areas of either low concentrations of like-charges, or really any concentration of opposing charges.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/electroninplate.gif\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-180\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/electroninplate.gif?resize=300%2C180\" alt=\"electroninplate\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Their motivator is the electrostatic force, their paths for motion are dictated by electric fields, and in most familiar cases, their conduits are through metal wires. \u00a0Metal allows for electrons to move more or less freely (I&#8217;ll get into how that works another time), and so when an electric field is set up within a metal wire, charges feel an electrostatic force and move. \u00a0That motion of charge is what we know as current. \u00a0Ok, that&#8217;s set.</p>\n<p>What happens when, instead of having empty space (note, not <i>air</i>, but<i> empty space</i>)\u00a0between two oppositely charged objects like above, you have a massive obstacle in between them? \u00a0An object that is resistive to the flow of charges, like say an insulator? \u00a0Well, we have what&#8217;s called a <b>dielectric</b>. \u00a0Dielectrics are basically big insulators that sit between two oppositely charged objects for the purpose of disrupting the flow of charge, and requiring more charge to build before the flow of charge can resume. \u00a0The easy way that I can think about it is like a dam in a river. \u00a0Normally a river would flow just fine when unobstructed, and you only need a minimal amount of water to resume that flow. \u00a0However, when a dam is built in that river, water must build up behind the dam before it can continue its flow. \u00a0If the river&#8217;s current is increased such that it can now go over the dam, you&#8217;ll have a waterfall over the dam (relating back to electricity, overcoming the dielectric strength of the insulator), and the flow will resume. \u00a0If that dam is destroyed by the increase in current, then the river will flow with a greater force than it did before the dam was built. \u00a0So it goes with dielectrics. \u00a0Note, the thinner the dielectric, the weaker the barrier, and the easier it is for current to flow. \u00a0This comes into play later.</p>\n<p>You can also use an already-charged object to induce a charge on a neutral, conducting object. \u00a0As you might imagine, this is called <b>induction</b>. \u00a0That&#8217;s the gist of it, now here&#8217;s the physics of it. \u00a0Consider the following system of a mysteriously-floating negatively-charged stick, an electrically neutral metal ball\u00a0\u00a0(good conductor) insulated from the ground, and some idiot standing nearby. \u00a0Cue the self-made artwork!</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NaxAlJHgSKc/UUpgVPClCcI/AAAAAAAAAUo/JWkh7kJn94c/s1600/induction1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NaxAlJHgSKc/UUpgVPClCcI/AAAAAAAAAUo/JWkh7kJn94c/s320/induction1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"160\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now, we know that opposite charges attract, and like charges repel. \u00a0So, if we bring the charged stick toward the neutral conducting ball (though not touching), we would expect that the positive and negative charges will separate based on their affinity for the negativity.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NWNT92d6xWE/UUphf7jX7YI/AAAAAAAAAUw/GvrGBK7uLvw/s1600/induction2.png\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NWNT92d6xWE/UUphf7jX7YI/AAAAAAAAAUw/GvrGBK7uLvw/s200/induction2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"107\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>The electrons naturally want to get as FAR away from the negatively-charged stick as is possible. \u00a0Unfortunately for them, without a conduit to some lower concentration of undesirable charges, they&#8217;re still confined to the structure of the metal ball. \u00a0But consider now the idiot connected to the ground. \u00a0The ground is special because it represents what is essentially an infinite reservoir of neutrality.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M9J5oZUO_1M/UUpkK5_E-YI/AAAAAAAAAU4/ye8MI6d7h5Q/s1600/induction3.png\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M9J5oZUO_1M/UUpkK5_E-YI/AAAAAAAAAU4/ye8MI6d7h5Q/s200/induction3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"119\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>All charges that are in unfavorable environments prefer to rush toward that neutrality by any available means. \u00a0When the idiot touches the now-unbalanced sphere, all of the electrons looking for a place to go rush toward his arm, through his body, and into the ground. \u00a0Since I don&#8217;t like this guy, let&#8217;s say that the current running through his body was enough to stop his heart and kill him. \u00a0He&#8217;s dead now. \u00a0Soon after his body hits the floor, the mysterious charged stick floats away, onto other mischief.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KOMJZ2QhQH8/UUpn4_wMZXI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/0JWcDyExlKE/s1600/induction4.png\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KOMJZ2QhQH8/UUpn4_wMZXI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/0JWcDyExlKE/s200/induction4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"97\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>With no reason to all be bunched up in one spot anymore, the positive charges redistribute due to their mutual repulsion. \u00a0What&#8217;s left is a dead body, and a positively charged sphere. \u00a0Ta da! Induction!</p>\n<p>So what have we learned thus far, aside from the danger of touching charged objects? \u00a0A) Charges, when given a conduit, tend to flow toward their electrical opposite. \u00a0B) If you stick an insulator in the path of the flow of charges, it&#8217;ll interrupt that flow until enough charge builds up behind the insulator to overwhelm it. \u00a0C) Charged objects, when brought near neutral objects, can induce a charge onto that neutral object. \u00a0D) A neutral object with an induced charge can become a charged object when its electrons have somewhere to go. \u00a0That&#8217;s all well and good, but how does any of this apply to lightning?</p>\n<p>Before I continue, please know that the theory of lightning creation still isn&#8217;t even fully fleshed out by the people that actually study the stuff. \u00a0So, what follows is what makes&#8230;enough sense to me.</p>\n<p>Now, consider the thundercloud.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u7bSRvPpYlw/UUptkB-wKTI/AAAAAAAAAVY/zTiQm9M2BCU/s1600/angrycloud.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u7bSRvPpYlw/UUptkB-wKTI/AAAAAAAAAVY/zTiQm9M2BCU/s200/angrycloud.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"191\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Your typical thundercloud is a cumulonimbus-type cloud (<a href=\"http://rationalwhimsy.com/science-sunday-the-basics-of-clouds/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">here for more on clouds</a>). \u00a0It&#8217;s big and bulky, full of liquid water at its bottom and small ice particles at its top, and has a large amount of turbulent air to help puff it up. \u00a0The turbulent air contains strong updrafts and downdrafts, occurring with regularity near one another. \u00a0The updrafts carry warm water droplets up from the base of the cloud, while the downdrafts transport ice crystals frozen at the top downward toward the base. \u00a0When the upward-moving water encounters the downward-moving ice, they meet like two great armies on the field of battle. \u00a0My own mind conjures up images of Aragorn and his army of the dead fighting at Minas Tirith. Yes, I&#8217;m a nerd of many facets, so hush. \u00a0The downward moving ice is the army of the dead colliding into the water droplets of Sauron, shearing electrons off and collecting them as they move across the battlefield, downward toward the base of the cloud. \u00a0It&#8217;s rarely a good idea to mix analogies. \u00a0Anyway, what we get here is a massive separation of charge, with all the negative charge building up at the base of the cloud over the neutral ground.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E2G8Ruka1gU/UUpxWJJbx9I/AAAAAAAAAVg/_H8uV5NAQc4/s200/how_lightning_works560.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">How ominous&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The negative base of the cloud induces a similarly-strong positive charge on the ground. \u00a0Awww snap, it looks like some current&#8217;s about to flow. \u00a0BUT WAIT! \u00a0There isn&#8217;t empty space between the cloud base and the ground! \u00a0There&#8217;s air, and air don&#8217;t like no free electrons moving through it. \u00a0No, friends. \u00a0Air is a dielectric. \u00a0Air don&#8217;t like none of that in its house.</p>\n<p>Thus the charge at the base of the cloud, with nowhere else to go (<i>I&#8217;m lying)</i>, just builds. \u00a0And it builds. \u00a0And it continues to build until a seriously tremendous amount of charge is present at the cloud base. \u00a0Worse yet, if the cloud happens to be caught up in a strong wind, it&#8217;ll be moving, building up massive amounts of positive charge on the ground as it goes. \u00a0At this point, it&#8217;s roaming and just LOOKING for something to piss it off so it can discharge some holy lightning. \u00a0Once it comes across an object tall enough for there to be significantly less air between the cloud base and the object, and to allow all that positive charge to flow through that object toward its top, you&#8217;ll get a massive electrical discharge. \u00a0The positive charges of the ground rush to meet the negative charges in the cloud base, ionizing the air between them, creating a bright, hot plasma. \u00a0LIGHTNING!!!</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QpNTtIN41sA/UUpz1xyyCHI/AAAAAAAAAVw/r-2dq5LujzE/s320/17950_sky_lightning_lightning_storm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"203\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wow.

\u00a0It&#8217;s beautiful here!&#8221;<!--more--></p>\n<p>Two years and three months later, I can confirm the well-known Seattle drear. \u00a0It feels like it&#8217;s cloudy more often than not, and it&#8217;s nearly always wet. \u00a0ALWAYS! \u00a0Am I just suffering from confirmation bias, or is Seattle&#8217;s weather always just generally crappy? \u00a0Well, being the scientist that I am, I sought to answer these interesting and personally-relevant questions.</p>\n<p>The initial idea that I had was to gather a mass amount of data regarding Seattle&#8217;s rainfall over the past 10 years, do some basic statistical analysis on that data, and create some plots of my results. \u00a0This also happened to coincide with my initial serious forays into learning <a href=\"http://www.python.org/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Python</a>, so it would be a good way to learn how to use Python to condense large data sets into easy-to-digest conclusions. \u00a0I went to the obvious sites first: <a href=\"http://weather.com/\">weather.com</a> and <a href=\"http://weather.gov/\">weather.gov</a>. \u00a0I ended up dumping a few hours into looking through each, finding them annoyingly frustrating to navigate, more frustrating to pull data from, and even more frustrating to try to manipulate said data with my fledgling knowledge of Python. \u00a0So, I abandoned those and did what any good scientist would do: complain about his data troubles to his friends on Facebook. \u00a0My colleague Jim commented on that post with a link to <a href=\"http://hint.fm/wind/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">an awesome wind map</a>, noting that someone found a way to use weather data, so I checked that out to distract myself for a little bit. \u00a0While on the page, I noticed that they had a link to some weather data for basic maps. \u00a0Intrigued, I hit the link and found <a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Weather Underground</a>. \u00a0They had data just how I wanted it! \u00a0So, I stole all of Seattle&#8217;s monthly data over the past 10 years and got to work.</p>\n<p><b>Note:\u00a0</b>This is my first data visualization post of what I hope to be many more in the future (inspired by my good colleague and Red Army co-member <a href=\"http://www.ifweassume.com/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Jim Davenport</a>). \u00a0I apologize in advance if the image format sucks with respect to my blog layout. \u00a0Now, let&#8217;s have a look at some data!

The bricks in the other two plots take the average values of the median (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">wiki: median</a>) cloud cover and humidity over that month. \u00a0I drew some lines in the leftmost plot to bracket the &#8220;nice season&#8221; in Seattle: May-Sept. \u00a0Also, the cloud cover percentages are <i>roughly</i> \u00b16%. \u00a0For whatever reason, the source site lists cloud cover in eighths of the sky (e.g. 4/8, 7/8) so I converted them to percentages. \u00a0Hence, error!</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">The lovely thing about this data is that it essentially speaks for itself. \u00a0The really truly dreary months are clearly October through April, where we get the worst of it all. \u00a0Anyone living here for at least a year could tell you that. \u00a0Worse yet, the averaged median cloud cover per month doesn&#8217;t dip below about 25%&#8230;at all, clearing up only between July and September. \u00a0This explains my Vitamin D deficiency last year! \u00a0<b>What&#8217;s the silver lining here? \u00a0If you ever want to visit Seattle to experience some of its real beauty, come in August!</b></p>\n<div class=\"\">\n<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s really interesting to me in this particular set of plots. Check out March 2010 in the left two. \u00a0It was uncharacteristically nice for March in Seattle! \u00a0Look at <u>all</u>\u00a0of the other March data on both graphs. \u00a0It&#8217;s a local minimum in both rainfall and cloud cover! \u00a0I got duped by Seattle!</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"separator\">After producing these pretty plots I began to wonder how the weather in Seattle compared to my home in NY. \u00a0So, I altered my Python script a little bit (i.e. changed &#8220;Seattle&#8221; to &#8220;New York&#8221;) and made the same three graphs for NYC (at JFK airport).</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gCWlcyKfPsU/ULWwoH4C9ZI/AAAAAAAAAS0/DOILd9NcP_w/s1600/newyorkweather_10yrs_monthly.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gCWlcyKfPsU/ULWwoH4C9ZI/AAAAAAAAAS0/DOILd9NcP_w/s640/newyorkweather_10yrs_monthly.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"separator\">Well, would you look at that: the amount of rainfall in NYC appears to be roughly on par with that of Seattle. But wait! What do the numbers say? <i><b>Between 2002 and 2012, </b></i><i>there are only 3 years where Seattle&#8217;s total rainfall exceeds New York&#8217;s!</i>\u00a0WHAT!? It can&#8217;t be! In 2006, 2010, and 2012, Seattle&#8217;s rainfall exceeds NYC&#8217;s by no more than 3.35 inches (2006). \u00a0NYC dwarfs Seattle in all other years, hitting a maximum difference of 23.89 inches last year. \u00a0Crazy. \u00a0The cloud cover is better in NYC though, being more or less even on average throughout the year at ~60%. \u00a0Lastly, as anyone who&#8217;s lived in or near NYC can tell you, humidity in NYC is horrid over the summer. Had I gotten info from somewhere on Manhattan island, I&#8217;m absolutely certain that the humidity result would&#8217;ve been just disgusting.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">For no other reason than the fact that I could, I decided to query one more city. \u00a0Here&#8217;s some results for Los Angeles via LAX.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tVzFCqocDNw/ULWwmyQWVtI/AAAAAAAAASs/i6cZVzzzWwE/s1600/losangelsweather_10yrs_monthly.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tVzFCqocDNw/ULWwmyQWVtI/AAAAAAAAASs/i6cZVzzzWwE/s640/losangelsweather_10yrs_monthly.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Uh, yeah. \u00a0There&#8217;s no contest here. \u00a0You want to know what LA&#8217;s min and max cumulative annual rainfall are over since 2002? 4.84 and 21.01 inches. \u00a0Seattle&#8217;s and New York&#8217;s? \u00a0(26.80, 48.64) and (34.84, 55.76) respectively. \u00a0That is nonsense. \u00a0Utter nonsense. \u00a0Ugh, I&#8217;m depressed already. \u00a0Bleh, 7 months to go until June&#8230;</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got for data today. \u00a0If you want to play with the data yourself, or use my code to reproduce some of this stuff, shoot me an email. \u00a0I&#8217;ll send you my code and the .tar files for each city. \u00a0My email&#8217;s on here somewhere right? \u00a0No? \u00a0nhuntwalker -at- gmail -dot- com.</p>\n<p><i><u>Credit where credit is due:</u></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&#8211; Jim Davenport for inspiring me to try some data viz stuff and providing me with a gateway to my source data. \u00a0Check his blog out. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ifweassume.com/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">It&#8217;s awesome</a>!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&#8211; Yusra AlSayyad for her Python wizardry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&#8211; Weather Underground for their mass amounts of data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&#8211; Python, for existing and being free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&#8211; AstroML: Machine Learning and Data Mining for Astronomy. \u00a0It&#8217;s an awesome package for Python consisting of various tools that we use to analyze and visualize data in astronomy. \u00a0It was produced by Zeljko Ivezic (my advisor), Andrew Connolly, Jacob VanderPlas (former grad student, now post doc), and Alex Gray. \u00a0<a href=\"http://astroml.github.com/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Link here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&#8211; <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">wget</a>. \u00a0This is a terminal command you can use to *ahem* borrow things from websites. \u00a0Used extensively here.</span></p>\n"}, "modified": "2015-11-17T07:13:59", "date_gmt": "2012-11-28T01:26:39", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=171", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=171", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/171"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/171/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:featuredmedia": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/172", "embeddable": true}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=171", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=171"}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>Before I moved out here to Seattle for graduate school I was repeatedly warned about how rainy it tends to be out here. \u00a0One person even described it as &#8220;London-esque&#8221;. \u00a0However, when I first visited back in March 2010 (this becomes relevant later), not only was it barely raining, but it was absolutely gorgeous for [&hellip;]</p>\n"}, "categories": [1], "tags": [8, 60, 52, 61, 2, 16, 3, 62], "guid": {"rendered": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/?p=171"}, "id": 171, "title": {"rendered": "Viz: Rain in Seattle?

inspiration for today&#8217;s title). \u00a0Let&#8217;s set the stage. \u00a0At times, the weather outside wouldn&#8217;t be conducive to practicing, or our spot on the lawn would be taken (couldn&#8217;t access the gym over the summer). \u00a0Perhaps it was raining that day or had rained heavily the night before. \u00a0Regardless, for whatever reason we&#8217;d have to find somewhere else to practice. \u00a0If we still decided to have practice, we&#8217;d typically end up in a building east of the Teacher&#8217;s College on Columbia&#8217;s campus. \u00a0In the lounge room of this building we&#8217;d gather up and start practice, right in the dead of summer. \u00a0Thus began the (in my opinion) Sweaty Hell that was our practice in that room.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">I have in my capoeira career had the fortune to practice with a few different instructors and see how they handle their classes differently with regards to students getting water. \u00a0Some will recognize that different people need water at different times and let them have it as needed, while others will have set intervals for breaks where people can get water. \u00a0In Sweaty Hell, there were maybe 2 water breaks available. \u00a0Maybe. \u00a0On top of that, there was an air conditioner in the room that could&#8217;ve alleviated some of the heated punishment, but Papito did not allow such things. \u00a0As such, every time we would have class there, I would damn near melt. \u00a0It was, to put it shortly, a somewhat harrowing experience for me, especially knowing how terrible my endurance is in capoeira.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">That Spring and Summer were also the first times that I visited the main Guerreiros academy out in Newark. \u00a0It&#8217;s amazing how I had been through Newark so many times in my life, going to and from my uncle&#8217;s house(s), and yet never once did I notice that there&#8217;s an entire Brazilian community sitting right next to the train station. \u00a0The school was located in what appeared to be a small old warehouse, embedded firmly within that neighborhood. \u00a0The first time that I had seen the students that practiced here was at my own batizado at Columbia. \u00a0Curious as to what their place was like, I ventured out there with a couple of other classmates. \u00a0It was&#8230;awkward for me. \u00a0Like that first day of class awkward. \u00a0You don&#8217;t really know anyone, and you don&#8217;t quite know how to fit in awkward. \u00a0My protocol was just to change into my whites and follow instructions.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">Looking back on it now, I don&#8217;t really remember what it was like. \u00a0Granted, it was&#8230;.2.5 years ago, and I had only been out there a handful of times. \u00a0There were a few distinct things, however, that stand out in my mind. \u00a0For one, there was a padded floor. \u00a0This meant that we were freer to practice acrobatics if we wanted to, seeing as how if we fell, that hit to the ground would be far softer than straight wood or linoleum. \u00a0Next was the feeling of community that was there, at least amongst those that were regulars to the school. \u00a0There seemed to just be a lot more comraderie than I had experienced at Columbia. \u00a0Not that there wasn&#8217;t a fair bit of it there; that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m saying at all. \u00a0It&#8217;s just that the atmosphere of friendliness and community at the Newark Guerreiros academy was tangible. \u00a0I almost wished that I could afford to make more trips out there to visit.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">On one occasion, a couple of us Columbia folk stayed after class at the Newark academy and went to the bar across the street with George Palmares. \u00a0I guess that he was a regular there? \u00a0Either way, we got a grand welcome when we went in with a few of the other students, and we took over the dance floor after a bit of time. \u00a0It was definitely fun, and the brazilians there were very welcoming. \u00a0It was still awkward as all hell though.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">Toward the middle of August 2010, I moved to Seattle in order to settle in before the start of my first year of graduate school. \u00a0Back in March 2010 when I had visited campus as a prospective student, I was taken on a tour of the campus by this dude representing the GO-MAP program. \u00a0During our walk, we struck up some conversation and I had told him that I had just started capoeira at Columbia. \u00a0In response, he had mentioned to me that he knew a dude on campus who practiced capoeira. \u00a0When I moved to Seattle in August, I kept that fact in mind and contacted him. \u00a0He forwarded me the info of his acquaintance Santiago, and I contacted Santiago to find out when he taught. \u00a0It was Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays on campus at 5:30 (I think?). \u00a0So, on some weekday in August, I went to their spot on the grass on the UW campus and waited for his class to start up. \u00a0His was my first introduction to the world of the angoleiro.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">Capoeira Angola is distinctly different from the Regional-ish, Senzala-ish capoeira that I had been trained in since that February. \u00a0For one, it was slower. \u00a0<i>Significantly</i>\u00a0slower, with much more of an emphasis on deliberate, well-formed movements, as well as bursts of trickiness (malandragem). \u00a0On top of that, the songs were a little bit different (and also much slower) than the ones that I had learned via Guerreiros. \u00a0The words were the same, but the rhythm of the berimbau, the melodies of the songs, and the pacing of the words were way different than what I had learned. \u00a0I distinctly remember being lightly scolded by Santiago for breaking out with &#8220;Da Da Da no Negro&#8221; (Get Get Get the Negro), since Santiago&#8217;s black and it can be construed as an offensive song. \u00a0 The third main bit that pops out in my mind was the way in which Santiago structured his class. \u00a0The lion&#8217;s share of it was based in body conditioning. \u00a0This makes sense, as all of those slow, drawn out, deliberate movements that are inherent to Angola require a lot of endurance-trained muscle.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img

helping Toby with handstand pushups at Santi&#8217;s practice</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So the warmup would consist of jogging, duck-walking, frog leaps, squats, crab-walking, walking on all fours, and other such exercises. \u00a0There was also &#8220;trinta&#8221; which translates to &#8220;thirty&#8221;, but translates in MY mind to &#8220;thirty headstand attempts, and perhaps another 30 handstand attempts.&#8221; \u00a0Talk about tests of endurance! \u00a0My arms would be SCREAMING at me after that, not to mention the profound fatigue in my legs after the warmup. \u00a0The warmup! \u00a0My start and consistent training in capoeira at Columbia had reforged my body to show, quite frankly, a fair bit of muscle that I&#8217;m still not quite used to seeing, and yet I would be winded halfway through practice! \u00a0This was the basis for my first capoeira apelido: Modelo (model). \u00a0The reasoning behind it, according to Santi, was that my body made me look like I could do a lot with it and last through training. \u00a0But, it&#8217;s only for show, like a model&#8217;s. \u00a0Yeah. \u00a0I&#8217;m not gonna lie, that one hurt for a long while. \u00a0It was a solid 7-8 months before I would be comfortable enough with myself to embrace the name, and introspective enough to use its meaning as constructive criticism and motivation.</p>\n<figure style=\"width:

border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">More practice on the &#8220;magic grass&#8221;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I practiced with Santi&#8217;s group for about a month, and through it met a handful of pretty cool people. \u00a0During that summer, I <b>rarely</b>\u00a0saw Santi play himself, as he was at the time recovering from an accident. \u00a0I also met Barok (pronounced bah-rOOk), this Ethiopian dude with some crazy hair that had a pretty fun playing style. \u00a0I thought he was pretty cool because he was black, had a pretty nice capoeira game, AND was a physics major at the university, much like myself! \u00a0Then there was Henry, a history major I think. \u00a0While his technique wasn&#8217;t as good as mine, he had (and still has) WAY more endurance than I&#8217;ve ever had. \u00a0When we&#8217;ve been at the same rodas since then, we tend to play each other because our levels kind of equal out. \u00a0And I always try to trip him. \u00a0Angie had a great love for capoeira, and seemed to be the organizational head for the group. \u00a0She had a very strong personality, but not so much that she couldn&#8217;t appreciate the game. \u00a0I&#8217;m still pretty cool with Toby, though I haven&#8217;t had the fortune to see much of him over the last couple years. \u00a0Then there was Joji, who was at that point one of the best non-ranked capoeiristas that I had seen to date. \u00a0He seemed to have everything: personal confidence (and thus a confident capoeira game), a unique and flowing, yet effective style, awesome technique and endurance, and a distinct talent for being able to read his opponents and play at their level. \u00a0I still admire his style today (and hope that one day I&#8217;ll be able to whup his ass).</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">Santiago had an angoleiro friend over in Port Orchard, Washington that was having a party (for Joji, I think) and wanted to know who would come with him. \u00a0I, not having anything else to do during that time, and curious about the greater capoeira community in the area, went along for the ride. \u00a0This was when I first met Gabriel Emeka (and family), and saw for my first time an entire half-day filled with food, friendship, and capoeira. \u00a0I&#8217;ve met a fair number of people in my life, yet few have been have welcoming as the Emekas. \u00a0From what I understand, Gabe is an architect and built his own house. \u00a0Because he&#8217;s also an avid angoleiro, he built a floor roda space into his house. \u00a0So cool. \u00a0Here&#8217;s a shot of his floor from above (not from the same event, but here for illustration purposes):</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

and it&#8217;s truly magnificent), but for now I want to focus on the capoeira. \u00a0It was here that I got my first chance to actually pick up and hold a berimbau. \u00a0With Guerreiros, I had never gotten a chance to handle the instruments, so I had no real impression of what it entailed. \u00a0Despite my many years as a cellist in high school and college, I was embarrassingly bad at playing music. \u00a0Holding the berimbau itself was a herculean feat. \u00a0Then there was being able to play a rhythm without dropping the damn thing. \u00a0It was interesting, though I wouldn&#8217;t play again for about 7-8 more months.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

\u00a0 Jesus! \u00a0It was Joji&#8217;s going-away roda, so they had him play a lot. \u00a0By the end of it, that green shirt he had was drenched in sweat. \u00a0It was also the first time I saw Gabe&#8217;s remarkable style. \u00a0I had never seen such control while upside down. \u00a0Little did I know that in the future I&#8217;d be at the receiving end of his foot control, but I digress. \u00a0They played a nice game, with Gabe being his fun-loving tricky self, and Joji showing off some decent skill. \u00a0I sat on the sidelines (I may have been playing an instrument at the time) and just drank it all in. \u00a0These were two people who knew each other&#8217;s games well, and were just having fun.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">I also got my chance to play my first few angola games. \u00a0I had never known fatigue like this. \u00a0It was something between 5 and 10 minutes of constant movement. \u00a0Constant kicking, dodging, and acute alertness, all while lactic acid built up in my muscles making me slower and less efficient. \u00a0It was also somewhat odd trying to mesh my high-game training with the distinctly low game of angola. \u00a0I got hit a few times, and I also managed to get in a few good hits myself. \u00a0I don&#8217;t remember well who I played against, but it was fun regardless.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">Once the school year started up in late September 2010, Santiago&#8217;s group moved off campus, and didn&#8217;t come back until the next summer. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t join them, mostly due to admitted laziness. \u00a0So it was that I started my 5-month break from capoeira. \u00a0I did other things in the meantime of course, but nothing could quite fill the hole that was left behind by the lack of capoeira in my life. \u00a0I developed a real, solid hunger for it; a real need in my life to be upside down! \u00a0When I finally did come back to it, it was as if I was being reacquainted with an old friend, and I was so ready to make that connection again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-19T01:22:51", "date_gmt": "2012-11-01T01:16:52", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=163", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=163", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/163"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/163/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:featuredmedia": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/50", "embeddable": true}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=163", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=163"}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>\u00a0Capoeira dominated much of my summer after the Batizado and the bulk of my research stuff was finished. \u00a0Because the weather had turned upward (as it does in New York, and NOT here in Seattle) and because Columbia&#8217;s Dodge Fitness Center was no longer available to us, every Tuesday and Thursday we&#8217;d find ourselves outside [&hellip;]</p>\n"}, "categories": [1], "tags": [5, 27, 26, 2, 28], "guid": {"rendered": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/?p=163"}, "id": 163, "title": {"rendered": "Capoeira Na Roda, Capoera Na Vida Part II: Inferno Suado e Condicionando de Angola"}, "comment_status": "open", "author": 1, "modified_gmt": "2015-09-19T01:22:51", "meta": [], "sticky": false, "slug": "capoeira-na-roda-capoera-na-vida-part-ii-inferno-suado-e-condicionando-de-angola", "template": "", "ping_status": "open"}, {"featured_media": 162, "format": "standard", "type": "post", "link": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/cross-post-gender-disparity-in-the-sciences/", "date": "2012-10-31T01:12:05", "content": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Another interesting article that I found on someone else&#8217;s blog:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/annanorth/what-male-and-female-scientists-say-about-women-in\">http://www.buzzfeed.com/annanorth/what-male-and-female-scientists-say-about-women-in</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Here, scientists of various statuses are interviewed and asked why they think there&#8217;s such a gender disparity between biology and the physical sciences. \u00a0Needless to say, the responses vary based on the gender of the respondent. \u00a0Here&#8217;s a sampling from the article:</span><!--more--></p>\n<div>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Men:</span></b></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;\">\u201cmorphological differences and biological differences [make men better at] hardcore math and physics.\u201d \u2014 male assistant professor, genetics</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;\">&#8220;[There are] some brain differences between men and women that explain it.&#8221; \u2014 male grad student, biology</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;\">\u201cOn balance [women are] just less interested in math.\u201d \u2014 male professor, biology</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;\">\u201cPhysics is more difficult for girls and you need a lot of thinking, and the calculation, and the logic.

Capoeira, and a long-standing interest in the histories and cultures of the descendants of black slaves in the Western Hemisphere, I&#8217;ve become pretty heavily interested in the religion (some would say cult, and I would say that&#8217;s disrespectful due to the connotation of the word &#8220;cult&#8221;) of Candombl\u00e9. \u00a0I&#8217;ll write something about Candombl\u00e9 as a whole at some later time, but with this series I&#8217;d like to focus in on the gods of Candombl\u00e9. \u00a0These gods are known as Orishas (or Orixas), and they rule over different parts of existence. \u00a0This particular post is going to be about Yemanj\u00e1, the Orisha of the waters and the feminine principle of Candombl\u00e9.</p>\n<p><!--more-->Yemanj\u00e1 appears throughout Candombl\u00e9, as well as Cuban Santer\u00eda, Haitian Vodou, and (originally) Nigerian Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 as the queen of the seas and oceans. \u00a0Before continuing, I&#8217;d like to point out that the name of this Orisha takes on different spellings between different cultures, and that I&#8217;ve chosen this particular spelling of her name because that&#8217;s how I was introduced to it via Capoeira. \u00a0Other spellings (and names) that I&#8217;ve come across in my brief research are:</p>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.qualiafolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/yemanja.jpg\"><img

Imanja, Yemay\u00e1, Jemanja, Yemalla, Yemana, Yemayah, Yemoja, Ymoja, Nana Bukulu, Yemonja, Yemowo, Jana\u00edna, La Diosa Del Mar, Mami Wata, Iemanya, La Sir\u00e8ne, and LaSiren (in Vodou).</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p><span class=\"s1\">There is no doubt in my mind that there are more names to be found. \u00a0However, in relating the entity across different cultures, it&#8217;s important to keep the pronunciation in mind. \u00a0That way, even though you may not recognize the word on the page, you&#8217;re able to still talk about the same entity with speech. \u00a0It&#8217;s my suspicion that the differences in spelling reflect the differences in phonetics across different cultures. \u00a0I feel as if it is the result of people trying to write down a name without knowing how to spell it first, and so they adapt the same sound to the phonetics of their particular language. \u00a0The pronunciation that I&#8217;m familiar with is yay-mahn-YAH, though there&#8217;s a certain rhythm to the phonetics that I can&#8217;t quite capture via text. \u00a0Such is life.</span></p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Nphuz53iOP8/UHs6I_f9nQI/AAAAAAAAAO0/LaUSgSUsEI0/s1600/yemanja_2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\"

class=\"s1\">So Yemanj\u00e1, queen of the waters. \u00a0Her name is a contraction of the Yoruba words Yey Omo Eja, which collectively mean &#8220;Mother Whose Children are the Fish.&#8221; Depending upon the source, her origin and relation to other Orishas change. \u00a0The commonality between them all is relatively brief. \u00a0She rules the waters and oceans. \u00a0She takes the form of a woman with long, black hair, and appears either wearing a flowing blue dress, a flowing white dress, or a flowing blue and white dress. \u00a0She wears a type of veil with beaded fringes that hide her face, and holds a mirror (often cited as a metal fan) in one hand representing her beauty. \u00a0Her colors are, as you might imagine, blue and white (and variations in the shades of each). \u00a0She&#8217;s always represented as one of the superior divinities, and associated with femininity and fertility, but her exact station changes with the person talking about her.</span></p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yNDbANwRxbk/UHs6ZsxnWCI/AAAAAAAAAO8/4w8ua7JwNCo/s1600/yemanja_3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\"

amongst the Orishas is where the interesting differences begin. \u00a0From some sources, she is considered the Mother of All, where all life came from the sea. \u00a0In others (including the image at the top of this post), she&#8217;s still one of the superior Orishas, but is the daughter of Ob\u00e0t\u00e1l\u00e1 (Oxal\u00e1, Orixal\u00e1, Olufon; the creator of human bodies), who in turn is the second son of Ol\u00f2r\u00fan (Olodumare, Olofi; the supreme orisha) who provides the vital energy, a.k.a. ax\u00e9 (ah-SHAY), for all of living existence. \u00a0In one more, she&#8217;s the daughter of Olokun, who is different from Ol\u00f2r\u00fan, and is genderless (or beyond gender) and also associated with the sea, unfathomable wisdom, and the unconscious.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\u00a0From her, many (or all) of the Orishas are said to be created. \u00a0I&#8217;m going to take a lot from Yoruba for this. \u00a0Different sources have her as the mother of Oy\u00e1 (Yans\u00e1, Ians\u00e4, Yansan; female orisha of winds and storms), Oba (marriage and domesticity; fem), Olokun (HOW?!), Olosa (orisha of the Lagos Lagoon; fem), Dada (newborns and vegetables; male), Shankpanna (Babalu Aye, Omolu; smallpox; male), Aje Shaluga (wealth; male), Orisra Oko (agriculture; male), Oke (mountains; male), Oxossi (hunters and forests; male), Oxumare (rainbows, movement, and activity; genderless), and Shango (thunder and war; male). \u00a0Exactly which of this bunch (and others not mentioned here) actually did come from her varies on location and who&#8217;s telling the story. \u00a0While she is formally the wife (and sister?!) of Aganju, Orisha of the soil, I remember her being the consort of someone else whose name escapes me. \u00a0Maybe it&#8217;ll come to me later.</div>\n<div class=\"p1\"></div>\n<div class=\"p1\">Due to the heavy indoctrination of slaves into the Christianity of their slave masters, the Orishas of Candombl\u00e9 also find themselves associated with some of the saints and holy figures of Christianity. \u00a0Yemanj\u00e1 in particular is connected with Nossa Senhora, or the Virgin Mary (considering her motherly status, this really confuses me. \u00a0However, I&#8217;ve never been one to make much sense of religion anyway).</div>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4RPxdVQrWow/UHs7Npcj-DI/AAAAAAAAAPM/v4WwK4w79t4/s1600/yemanja_5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\"

class=\"s1\">Aside from all of her familial relations and religious associations, the Yemanj\u00e1 the Orisha has a personality, and women that are said to be daughters of Yemanj\u00e1 tend to embody some of these elements of her personality. \u00a0She can be at times be coquettish and vain, as she is said to be quite beautiful and knows it. \u00a0At the same time though, she is seen as the loving and protective mother of mankind. \u00a0She cares deeply for all her children, comforting them and cleansing them of sorrow. \u00a0She does not easily lose her temper, but when angry she can be like the Sea in a storm\u2014wildly and indiscriminately violent and destructive. \u00a0She plays the role of provider (fish to fishermen), teacher, and possessor of the secrets of the depths of the ocean. \u00a0Oftentimes in Western society, her more powerful nature is downplayed, as women tend to have been forced into a backseat role. \u00a0However, this aspect of strength that she possesses is as much a part of her character as her role as a mother. \u00a0In total, she is the main Feminine Principle of Candombl\u00e9, Y\u00f2r\u00fab\u00e1, and Santer\u00eda, and all that that entails.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Because Yemanj\u00e1 is such a large figure in Candombl\u00e9 (and the others), she has associated with her many ceremonial rituals with pretty specific elements. \u00a0These celebrations typically incorporate someone that embodies the Orisha through dance as well as costume. This portion is all coming from the same source [7] (with grammar and spelling edited because their grasp of English drives me nuts), so take it up with them if you disagree. \u00a0Her dance movements represent the sea&#8217;s tumbling waves, these moves resemble the art of sewing nets, but also commonly represent a story line. \u00a0Her ocean dancing represents the salty water cleansing the distressed soul, or a newborn. \u00a0There is a lot of emphasis on the hands and the legs in Iemanja&#8217;s dance. \u00a0The hands alternate with palms that are neither flat nor round. \u00a0Then there is the shifting of weight from one knee to the other. \u00a0Her dances can also be done with the help of a skirt instead of the hands, or her fan, to represent ease. \u00a0She usually dances with a silver blue dress and something which resembles a fishing net, so as to represent herself as both fetus <i>[is this really supposed to be fetus?] </i>and fish. \u00a0Her metals are lead and silver, and her colors are blue hues and whites<i>. \u00a0</i>The ensemble varies only slightly for different candombles, and fundamentally consists of a silver-colored metal crown (often fringed with beads), bead necklaces, a blouse, fan, crown, sword, heavily-starched underskirts, silver-colored metal bracelets, armlets, and skirt bangles.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The fan (abebe), which is silver-colored metal, represents her beauty and her status as Oxala&#8217;s younger wife. \u00a0With the swaying of the fan back and forth, Iemanja has the power to bring peace and coolness to the universe. \u00a0This motion of the fan can also represent the fanning away of negative forces. \u00a0Usually, twelve to sixteen stranded necklaces are worn in festivals, which contain silver symbolizing the clarity of the surface of the water. \u00a0These also represent Iemanja&#8217;s composed and principled moods. \u00a0The skirt (saia) establishes its fullness from a couple or more petticoats (anaguas). \u00a0A unique starching technique was used to make these anaguas, and was handed down from mother to daughter by slaves, though today it is only with the boundaries of candomble.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p><span class=\"s1\">I personally like the idea of Yemanj\u00e1. \u00a0I like the concept of having a female entity act as the divine royalty of the seas and the origin of all creation. \u00a0It makes mythological sense to me, considering many aspects of the sea and who I know my own mother and other strong women in my family to be. \u00a0For one, the ocean is vast, with water covering roughly 70% of the Earth&#8217;s surface. \u00a0Its extent is vast, and as such its temperament has far-reaching consequences. \u00a0Currents under the water&#8217;s surface cause warm water to circulate to northern latitudes, and the capacity of water to regulate heat keeps coastal cities secure against wild fluctuations in temperature. \u00a0The gentle rolling of waves onto and away from the coast are calming like a mother&#8217;s comfort. \u00a0Life began in the waters, as our lives begin inside our mothers. \u00a0T</span>he oceans provide food and oftentimes a gateway to the rest of the world, as mothers do. \u00a0On the flip side, the ocean&#8217;s wrath can strike the fear of god into you, like mom can when you&#8217;ve stirred up her anger. \u00a0Hurricanes that develop over the water can level cities, while tsunamis can wipe miles of civilization from the face of the Earth. \u00a0As a mother might be inclined to remind you when you&#8217;ve sufficiently pissed her off, she brought you into this world and she can just as easily remove you from it. \u00a0So it is with the oceans.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p><span class=\"s1\">I happen to think that artwork of Yemanj\u00e1 is particularly gorgeous. So, before the references get up there, I&#8217;m going to just let loose with a handful of images of Yemanj\u00e1 as supplied by Google. \u00a0There are of course many representations of her, but I&#8217;m going to stick to the brown-skinned ones because Candombl\u00e9 is a religion founded by brown people. \u00a0And because I&#8217;m biased, as I am also brown people.

font-size: small;\">A retinal implant has given a brief glimpse of light to a small number of blind people, and could one day be a common treatment for vision loss due to injury or disease.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">Shawn Kelly, a senior systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, has developed a computer chip that translates camera images into electrical pulses that the nerves inside the brain can understand. The result is vision.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">The cameras are incredibly small and mounted to a pair of glasses. The digital information picked up from the camera is sent along a wire to a thin film surgically implanted in the back of the patient&#8217;s eye, between the sclera and the retina. The electrical signals stimulate the nerves in the retina, and that allows the patient to see. The system is powered via induction &#8212; not much current is necessary since the electric field doesn&#8217;t have to penetrate far into the head.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">It&#8217;s a far cry from the bionic eyes of science fiction, though. The resolution is only 256 pixels total, because that&#8217;s how many electrodes can be made to fit on the back of the film. A typical digital camera has resolutions measured in millions of pixels and ordinary human vision involves approximately 1 million nerves, and more than 100 millon rod and cone cells. But it is something.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">&#8220;At 256 we start to get some function back to people,&#8221; Kelly told Discovery News.\u00a0 He said people who tested the system reported the ability to see some shapes and light and dark regions. The tests were not &#8220;field tests&#8221; in real-world conditions, but situations where the implant was used for a few hours and then removed.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">There have been other proposals for retinal implants. Recent work in Britain used a\u00a0<a href=\"http://news.discovery.com/tech/self-powered-bionic-eye-restore-eyesight-120518.html\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_self\">self-powered retinal implant\u00a0</a>that is powered by light that enters the eye rather than the external glasses. At the University of Tubingen in Germany, another project involves an implant that has a\u00a0<a href=\"http://news.discovery.com/tech/retinal-implant-birghtens-future-for-blind.html\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_self\">1,500 pixel resolution</a>\u00a0that is inserted below the retina.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">Kelly said the difference with his design is that the processor is sealed well enough that no water vapor gets inside. Ordinarily the liquids in the eye (and the body generally) are in chemical equilibrium, but any implanted device with wires has spaces in it that can allow small amounts of vapor to form, which can reduce the implant&#8217;s effectiveness.&#8221; We have more intelligence in the eye,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;Ours is designed to be stable long term.&#8221;</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">One kind of blindness that will be targeted with this device is retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary disease that destroys the cells in the eye that recieve light. Military veterans could also be helped. (Kelly recently recieved a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2012/june/june8_retinalprosthesis.html\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_self\">$1.1 million grant</a>\u00a0from the Department of Veterans&#8217; affairs). Some veterans of World War II and Korea suffer from age-related macular degeneration. Others had their eyes damaged by laser rangefinders, Kelly said. The lasers (which are far more powerful than barcode scanners or CD players) can injure the eyes in a way that causes damage later in life.</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-19T01:00:18", "date_gmt": "2012-10-14T00:57:43", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=146", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=146", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/146"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/146/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:featuredmedia": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/147", "embeddable": true}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=146", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=146"}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>I don&#8217;t have the words to explain how spectacular this is. \u00a0Instead, I&#8217;ll let the article do that. \u00a0Here&#8217;s the link: http://news.discovery.com/tech/retinal-prosthesis-120613.html .\u00a0\u00a0I&#8217;ll repost the discovery here.</p>\n"}, "categories": [1], "tags": [22, 16], "guid": {"rendered": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/?p=146"}, "id": 146, "title": {"rendered": "Science Being Awesome: Retinal Prosthesis"}, "comment_status": "open", "author": 1, "modified_gmt": "2015-09-19T01:00:18", "meta": [], "sticky": false, "slug": "science-awesome-retinal-prosthesis", "template": "", "ping_status": "open"}, {"featured_media": 144, "format": "standard", "type": "post", "link": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/science-sunday-the-basics-of-clouds/", "date": "2012-10-14T00:48:33", "content": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<figure id=\"attachment_144\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/clouds-1259.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-144\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/clouds-1259.jpg?resize=400%2C269\" alt=\"After taking all this time to write this post about clouds, you'd think that I could identify the types of clouds in this image.

I live to dream and reach for the stars, and if I miss a star then I grab a handful of clouds.&#8221; ~Mike Tyson</em></p>\n<p>Like Mike Tyson, today we&#8217;ll be missing the stars and instead grabbing at clouds. \u00a0Sure this seems somewhat random, considering what my subject matter (not to mention my profession) has typically been, \u00a0but this post is borne out of two completely unrelated things. \u00a0First and foremost is my desire to learn about things outside of my field. \u00a0I spend hours each day, every day of the week accumulating knowledge about astronomy in general and stars in particular. \u00a0This has resulted in a sort of scientific tunnel vision, where I neither know of or pay attention to anything that doesn&#8217;t concern stars. \u00a0I feel like I&#8217;ve lost touch with a lot of the science that goes on in the rest of the world, and so I&#8217;d like to reach out every now and again and learn about what other things the Universe has to offer beyond the various happenings of huge balls of burning hydrogen/helium plasma.</p>\n<p>The second motivation for this post comes from my girlfriend&#8217;s affinity for clouds. \u00a0Some days she just hangs out outside and looks up, staring at the shapes and different species of cloud, getting lost in their dance across the sky. \u00a0Then she calls me or sends me a text message to tell me about them, to which I invariably respond with my own personal disdain for clouds (I live in Seattle. \u00a0I have more cloud than I know what to do with). \u00a0Even though there&#8217;s no love lost between clouds and myself, I&#8217;d still like to know what makes them tick. \u00a0Hence, we have this post.</p>\n<p>Since I actually have no real training in this subject, I&#8217;m actually going to try to rely a little less on Wikipedia and a little more on websites with &#8220;atmospheric&#8221;, &#8220;physics&#8221;, &#8220;chemistry&#8221;, or &#8220;meteorology&#8221; in the name. \u00a0Also, if you want to skip much of the scientific inquiry here (in which case I&#8217;d ask you why you&#8217;re even looking at a post entitled &#8220;Science Sunday&#8221;), you can jump to the very brief summary at the end.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-elDZ8Sdh0Yw/UHqjUyuG7iI/AAAAAAAAANI/DIRh5DD-ybM/s320/evaporation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"167\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Warm air gives these water molecules a chance at freedom. FREEDOM!!!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As with any subject that I might write about, but actually know very little about going in, let&#8217;s start with the basics. \u00a0According to the <a href=\"http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=cloud1\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">American Meteorological Society</a>, clouds are a visible aggregate of minute water droplets and/or ice particles in the atmosphere above the Earth&#8217;s surface. \u00a0That&#8217;s pretty straight forward, and falls right in line with the idea of clouds as these large wispy things. \u00a0But how does water come to be suspended up in the atmosphere?</p>\n<p>Well mon fr\u00e8re, when water gets evaporated from the surface of the Earth (whether from land or from oceans), it rises into the air. \u00a0Why does water vapor rise? \u00a0While writing this, I realized that I actually couldn&#8217;t answer this question off the top of my head because I simply did not know. \u00a0Hadn&#8217;t really thought about it before. \u00a0It was just one of those things that I knew happened because I have always <i>known</i> it to happen. \u00a0So, I asked Google &#8220;what makes water vapor rise?&#8221; and was rewarded with <a href=\"http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_makes_water_vapor_rise\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">a nice and concise answer</a>. \u00a0Water vapor is a gas made of water molecules, each one of which contains one oxygen atom bound to two hydrogen atoms. \u00a0While the surrounding air is a mixture of different gases, the bulk of it is <a href=\"http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryfaqs/f/aircomposition.htm\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">composed of</a>\u00a0diatomic nitrogen (~78%) and diatomic oxygen (~21%). \u00a0The molecular mass of water is 18 atomic mass units (16 + 1 + 1), while the molecular mass of the overwhelming majority of air molecules is heavier by far (14+14 = 28 and 16+16 = 32 respectively). \u00a0Thus, as water molecules are lighter than the surrounding air, they will rise when vaporized until they have time to mix with the air. \u00a0The resulting moist air is lighter than any nearby dryer air at the same temperature, and will then also rise above said dryer air.</p>\n<p>As the moist air rises, it expands due to encountering lower air pressure (gases increase in volume when the pressure on them decreases) and cools down (through a negligibly small exchange of heat with the surrounding air) to the dew point of that air, which is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated (cannot hold anymore vapor). \u00a0How does this air decrease in temperature and yet exchange no actual heat with the surrounding gas? \u00a0This has to do with two of those little wonders of thermodynamics (thermo), <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/heat.html#c1\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Heat</a>\u00a0and a little something called <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/firlaw.html\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Work</a>.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 224px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ptrnth-yXMc/UHqkZzAFKVI/AAAAAAAAANY/8YPHDrqT194/s320/temperatureheat.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is external heat input changing\u00a0the temperature of the gas. This is\u00a0NOT what&#8217;s happening with our\u00a0moist air.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In thermo, a gas is said to be heated (or cooled) when the temperature of that gas increases (or decreases). \u00a0Fairly simple there. \u00a0The important thing though is to distinguish between a gas having its temperature altered because of a change in the gas itself, and a difference in because of some energy exchange with its surroundings. \u00a0<a href=\"http://physics.about.com/od/glossary/g/temperature.htm\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Temperature</a>\u00a0is a measurement of the <i>average kinetic energy </i>of the ensemble of particles that comprise some substance. \u00a0Essentially this means that temperature measures the average of the speeds of individual atoms in a gas. \u00a0High-temperature gases have particles that are very energetic, and vice versa. \u00a0A change in temperature of a gas is therefore a change in the energy of the particles of that gas. \u00a0This is an important point, so read it again if you didn&#8217;t get it the first time.</p>\n<p>Now we move to the second thermo concept, Work. \u00a0Work is done when energy is exchanged by either changing the volume of a system (in this case some bubble of air), the pressure within the system, or both. \u00a0If a bubble of moist air expands into the dryer air around it, it&#8217;s physically pushing that dryer air outward and away as its volume increases. \u00a0This type of action, simple as it is, takes energy. \u00a0Thus, it&#8217;s doing Work in pushing the surrounding air, and therefore the gas itself loses energy as it expands.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VnmLhtzOOEY/UHqlLWH1qOI/AAAAAAAAANg/t8hhbKav4ZQ/s320/adiab_cool.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"263\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cooling from changes in pressure and volume</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s go back to the difference between an internal energy change in a gas and some external energy changing that gas. An internal change in the gas would be some bubble of air exchanging the kinetic energy (temperature) of the gas particles for an increase or decrease in its size (volume). \u00a0An external agent changing the gas would be that same bubble of air having its temperature changed because of some injection of energy into the bubble (radiation input or something).</p>\n<p>For rising moist air, there&#8217;s no heat exchange with the surrounding air to decrease its temperature. \u00a0Instead what&#8217;s happening is that the gas is expanding, and in doing so is drawing energy for that expansion out of the kinetic energy of the individual gas particles. \u00a0This decreases the <i>average</i>\u00a0kinetic energy of the ensemble of gas particles, thus decreasing the temperature of the moist bubble.</p>\n<p>As the temperature of the air decreases, its capacity to hold more water vapor also decreases. \u00a0What I&#8217;m really saying here is that the capacity for the moist air to maintain water in its evaporated state decreases. \u00a0Why is that? \u00a0This was yet another question that I couldn&#8217;t answer off the top of my head, but now that I&#8217;ve looked it up it makes plenty of sense. \u00a0If you want to keep water vapor from becoming water liquid, you have to prevent water molecules from bonding to one another. \u00a0And let me tell you, water molecules love to bond. \u00a0In order to do this, you have to have enough energy to break any potential bonds between water molecules. \u00a0You can think of it like being a hero in an action movie, holding up a collapsing ceiling so that your friends can escape, where the strength that you use to keep the ceiling up is analogous to the energy needed to keep bonds apart. \u00a0As long as you have enough strength to hold the ceiling up, you can keep your friends from being killed. \u00a0The second your strength falters though, your friends become a nice, red paste on the dungeon floor. \u00a0Similarly, when a gas no longer has the energy to keep bonds between molecules from forming, liquid water forms and condenses out of the air.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LSMd58eN1PM/UHql_IN6mAI/AAAAAAAAANo/J5lU1J1SLH8/s1600/05-17-water-droplets-raindrops.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LSMd58eN1PM/UHql_IN6mAI/AAAAAAAAANo/J5lU1J1SLH8/s320/05-17-water-droplets-raindrops.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"215\" border=\"0\" /></a>So yeah, the temperature of the moist air bubble decreases down to the point (dew point temperature) at which it cannot hold any more water vapor. \u00a0If the air is cooled further, it sheds the vapor that it can no longer hold, and liquid water condenses out into a cloud. \u00a0This liquid condenses onto what are known as cloud condensation nuclei, which are particles (dust, salt, burnt stuff) light enough to be held aloft by air currents. \u00a0These particles are exceedingly small in size. \u00a0I&#8217;m talking like microscopic (0.000001 cm) at the largest. \u00a0My question to the internet was &#8220;why does water need to condense onto stuff? \u00a0Why can&#8217;t it just glob up into liquid water on its own?&#8221; \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t met with a swift and simple answer, so this time <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_nuclei\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">I defer to Wikipedia</a> with a promise to look up an actual source and scientific explanation for this.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PeTfu8AsExQ/UHqmxoMe_AI/AAAAAAAAANw/KLlj2QQQ71A/s320/img_full_46359.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"187\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Not the CLEAREST diagram in the world, sure. In position 2, the drag force is less than the force of gravity, so the particle accelerates downward. \u00a0In position 3, they&#8217;re equal, so there&#8217;s no acceleration.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So now we&#8217;ve got our clouds. \u00a0Large, hulking conglomerations of water molecules condensed onto various dust particles in the atmosphere. \u00a0If you just wanted to know how clouds form, you could stop here, or skip to the end where I talk about the different cloud types. \u00a0If, however, you&#8217;re innately curious like myself, you might want an answer to just one more question: how in the hell do these things stay afloat?! \u00a0Or as one website puts it, <a href=\"http://lamp.tu-graz.ac.at/~hadley/whydontcloudsfall.html\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Why don&#8217;t clouds fall?<br />\n</a><br />\nThe answer here is that clouds actually DO fall (just learned this while writing). \u00a0They just fall extremely slowly. \u00a0I defer to the above link for the more quantitative explanation, but I&#8217;ll point out the quasi-quantitative highlights here. \u00a0If you were in Physics 101 (or 151 at my undergrad college because&#8230;I don&#8217;t know why), you&#8217;d assume that any falling object accelerates at a rate of 9.8 meters per second every second. \u00a0This is the acceleration due to the Earth&#8217;s gravitational pull on that object, and is much of the reason why people used to think that t<a href=\"http://www.gantless.com/paper.html\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">hrowing a penny off of the empire state building would kill someone.</a>\u00a0 However, if you paid attention in that class, you&#8217;d notice that one thing was always assumed with any Falling Object Problem: air friction was neglected. \u00a0This is because air friction (aka drag) slows things down as they fall. \u00a0Air friction increases as the physical size of your falling object increases, the speed of its descent increases, and the viscosity of the air increases. \u00a0A falling object will reach terminal velocity (i.e. will not fall faster) when its gravitational force (based solely on its mass) becomes equal to the drag force. \u00a0Water droplets are pretty damn light, so they reach their terminal velocity fairly quickly. \u00a0The result is that they &#8220;fall&#8221; with a gentleness that would make feathers jealous.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s summarize the science here.\u00a0 Water evaporates from the Earth&#8217;s surface and rises. \u00a0Then, it mixes with dry air, expands and cools. \u00a0Because of the cooling, water condenses onto dust particles, and aggregates into clouds. \u00a0The clouds are then held aloft by the drag in the air and air currents pushing against their descent. \u00a0The following graphic is just perfect for this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-crM3WnsJCqc/UHqnx8G8btI/AAAAAAAAAN4/lyXpbLL6XM0/s1600/cloud_formation.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-crM3WnsJCqc/UHqnx8G8btI/AAAAAAAAAN4/lyXpbLL6XM0/s400/cloud_formation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"400\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now we get to the different general cloud types (and some notable subtypes). \u00a0I had no idea that they were organized into families, genuses, and species like animals are. \u00a0Sweet Jesus!

The worst thing in life is to look back and say: &#8220;I would have; I could have; I should have.&#8221; Take risks, make mistakes.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>3. Everyone in the world is just an ordinary person. Some people may wear fancy hats or have big titles or (temporarily) have power and want you to think they are above the rest. Don&#8217;t believe them. They have the same doubts, fears, and hopes; they eat, drink, sleep, and fart like everyone else. Question authority always but be wise and careful about the way you do it.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>4. Make a Life List of all those things you want to do: travel to places; learn a skill; master a language; meet someone special. Make it long and do some things from it every year. Don&#8217;t say &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it tomorrow&#8221; (or next month or next year). That is the surest way to fail to do something. There is no tomorrow, and there is no &#8220;right&#8221; time to begin something except now.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>5. Practice the Irish proverb:\u00a0<em>Moi an olge agus tiocfaidh s\u00ed</em>\u00a0&#8220;Praise the child and she will flourish.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>6. Be kind and go out of your way to help people &#8212; especially the weak, the fearful, and children. Everyone is carrying a special sorrow, and they need our compassion.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>7. Don&#8217;t join the military or any organization that trains you to kill. War is evil. All wars are started by old men who force or fool young men to hate and to kill each other. The old men survive, and, just as they started the war with pen and paper, they end it the same way. So many good and innocent people die. If wars are so good and noble, why aren&#8217;t those leaders who start wars right up there fighting?</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>8. Read books, as many as you can. They are a wonderful source of delight, wisdom, and inspiration. They need no batteries or connections, and they can go anywhere.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>9. Be truthful.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>10. Travel: always but especially when you are young. Don&#8217;t wait until you have &#8220;enough&#8221; money or until everything is &#8220;just right.&#8221; That never happens. Get your passport today.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>11. Pick your job or profession because you love to do it. Sure, there will be some things hard about it, but a job must be a joy. Beware of taking a job for money alone &#8212; it will cripple your soul.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>12. Don&#8217;t yell. It never works, and it hurts both yourself and others. Every time I have yelled, I have failed.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>13. Always keep promises to children. Don&#8217;t say &#8220;we&#8217;ll see&#8221; when you mean &#8220;no.&#8221; Children expect the truth; give it to them with love and kindness.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>14. Never tell anyone you love them when you don&#8217;t.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>15. Live in harmony with Nature: go into the outdoors, woods, mountains, sea, desert. It&#8217;s important for your soul.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>16. Visit Ireland. It&#8217;s where the soul of our family was born &#8212; especially the West: Roscommon, Clare, and Kerry.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>17. Hug people you love. Tell them how much they mean to you now; don&#8217;t wait until it&#8217;s too late.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>18. Be grateful. There is an Irish saying: &#8220;This is a day in our lives, and it will not come again.&#8221; Live every day with this in mind.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><em>As was written in his obituary, James K. Flanagan &#8220;was proudly liberal and fought unyieldingly for the underdog. He was an accomplished author, poet, and seanchai &#8212; Irish storyteller; he reveled in recounting the joy of growing up Catholic in Jersey City and his adventures in the Adirondack Mountains and on the Western coast of Ireland. His greatest love was spending time with his family, most of all his five grandchildren&#8221; Ryan (11); Conor (10); Brendan (9); Charles (8); and Mary Catherine (5).&#8221;</em></p>\n</div>\n"},

originally written as part of a bio post about me, but the bio ended up going a little bit more personal than I had originally intended. \u00a0There was still the bit about capoeira though, and I didn&#8217;t want it to stay in the vault just because I can&#8217;t write short, non-personal blurbs about myself. \u00a0I talk about my introduction to and involvement in capoeira in my series\u00a0<a href=\"http://rationalwhimsy.com/capoeira-na-roda-capoera-na-vida-part-i-no-inicio-com-os-guerreiros/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">capoeira na roda, capoeira na vida</a>, so with this post I&#8217;ll just say a little about capoeira itself. \u00a0Bear in mind, this is as brief as I can manage to get while still giving a solid overview of what goes on in capoeira.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sylWtoQOoLo/UHBhAB0tRJI/AAAAAAAAAL8/8zf3prze0kA/s1600/slaveroda.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright\"

at its base combines dancing, fighting, and music. \u00a0The exact time and circumstances of its creation remain unknown, so I&#8217;m going to skip over the detailed history of the martial art for now. \u00a0However, it is known to have been created by Afro-Brazilian slaves some time during the 16th century. \u00a0One of the best ways I&#8217;ve heard its origin described is as an amalgam of different aspects of the African cultures that were brought together due to the slave trade into Brazil. \u00a0This makes a lot of sense considering the similarities between the instruments of capoeira and African instruments, as well as the similarities between the religion of many of the blacks that practice capoeira and some of the religions in Africa. \u00a0And also the black people. \u00a0Because they&#8217;re black people. \u00a0Anyway, yes. \u00a0Dancing, fighting and music.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 255px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mestre Bimba, aka Manoel dos Reis Machado</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At a given a formal capoeira event, you&#8217;ll see some standard things. \u00a0The first thing that you&#8217;ll probably notice is that everyone&#8217;s wearing white pants and white shirts, with colored ropes around their waists (if it&#8217;s a school that practices the Angola style, it may be yellow shirts and black pants). \u00a0The insistence upon white as the school uniform comes from a man known as Mestre Bimba (mestre = master, much like a sensei in karate, or a sifu in kung fu). \u00a0Mestre Bimba is the man that legitimized capoeira in Brazil, as before him it was solely associated with black gangs. \u00a0As part of this legitimization, he insisted that his students wear a clean white uniform, as white is thought to represent purity. \u00a0The colored ropes are known as cordas (COR-dahs), and represent a student&#8217;s proficiency in their practice of capoeira. \u00a0The meaning of each color varies wildly from school to school, where a beginner&#8217;s white in one school might be a mestre&#8217;s white in another. \u00a0The difference is usually pretty obvious though, even without seeing them perform.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-26fjUlpSd5s/UHBhqrBsJlI/AAAAAAAAAMM/0RIC5lOuNF0/s1600/roda.jpg\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-26fjUlpSd5s/UHBhqrBsJlI/AAAAAAAAAMM/0RIC5lOuNF0/s320/roda.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" border=\"0\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A damn large roda</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The next thing that you may notice is that when two people enter combat, they do it while being surrounded by everyone else who&#8217;s there in a circle, much like the fights people might have in high school. \u00a0This circle is known officially as the roda, pronounced HOH-dah (it&#8217;s really important to get the silent &#8220;h&#8221;). \u00a0The roda is important to capoeira as it provides structure for the games. \u00a0Otherwise, the embattled capoeiristas would fight all over the place (trust me, this happens anyway). \u00a0Some believe that it even provides energy to the fighters, as the energy of the people on the outside of the roda circulates amongst the onlookers and is given to the fighters.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7oOu34mZzlQ/UHBiYVezU8I/AAAAAAAAAMU/S9iDLActGbE/s1600/capoeiraattack.jpg\"><img

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Attack and defense, with the defense even serving as another attack</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another notable is that when people fight, they rarely if ever actually make physical contact. \u00a0In fact, many of the fights look like they&#8217;re entirely choreographed. \u00a0This is not something that you&#8217;d expect from a martial art. \u00a0Why is that? \u00a0The way that it was explained to me (I forget by who) is that capoeira is a game (jogo) first and a fight second. \u00a0The emphasis therefore is on playing a game that makes people want to watch (in portuguese: joga bonito que eu quero ver) and learn from you (joga bonito que eu quero aprender), and not beating your opponent to a pulp. \u00a0The latter would be easy, as you could simply rush into the roda, tackle your opponent to the ground, and start pummeling their face. \u00a0But that removes much of the &#8220;art&#8221; from the martial art. \u00a0The emphasis is on technique and fully expressing the movements, as well as having a physical conversation with your opponent by flowing with them. \u00a0This is where the notion of choreography comes in. \u00a0No actual jogo is choreographed. \u00a0There may be some sequences that appear in a capoeirista&#8217;s jogo, but it&#8217;s all mixed together on the spot. \u00a0The conversation that two capoeiristas have is one of attack and defense. \u00a0If I kick at you, you know instinctively to defend yourself by getting out of the way. \u00a0Then, now that I&#8217;m open, you know to attack back, where I&#8217;ll get out of the way. \u00a0I may let loose with a string of attacks, each one you&#8217;ll know to dodge. \u00a0Then you&#8217;ll fight back and I&#8217;ll try not to get hit. \u00a0And so it goes on and on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RjsgKm3WIy4/UHBlHCtJ99I/AAAAAAAAAMk/71rQjojjFf0/s1600/ginga.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\"

say anything about the ginga, the basic swinging movement of capoeira. \u00a0In fact, I&#8217;d probably be yelled at for it by a variety of people. \u00a0The ginga is what you do when you&#8217;re not doing anything at all. \u00a0Se n\u00e3o ataca ou defensa, voc\u00ea deve gingar (If you don&#8217;t attack or defend, you must ginga). \u00a0The ginga gives your movement rhythm, and serves as a launching point for any capoeira movement. \u00a0It gives you your basic stance, guarding your face with one hand and your side with the other, while giving you a solid footing so that no one trips you up too easily. \u00a0It gives you a little bit of unpredictability too, as you can perform most movements from literally any point in the ginga (if you&#8217;re skilled enough). \u00a0It also gives your particular capoeira game a smattering of your own individuality. \u00a0Every ginga is different, and while there are many wrong ways to ginga, there&#8217;s no one right way. \u00a0It should never be mechanical, and always have elements of your own personal swing. \u00a0And of course, always keep your face guarded. \u00a0Because if you don&#8217;t, someone will try to check you on it, and while it is a very quick and direct way to learn to correct your form, a broken nose is never fun.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XxFZB_spWK8/UHBiypf6jvI/AAAAAAAAAMc/c_cpFna7HQE/s320/capoeira-kids-bateria.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"268\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kids bateria</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The last major notable is the presence of music. \u00a0There are almost always instruments at every capoeira roda. \u00a0The staples are the berimbau, the atabaque, and the pandeiro, though there may be a host of others such as the agogo, and the reco-reco. \u00a0The berimbau is most easily described as looking like a bow (like one that fires arrows) with a large gourd (caba\u00e7a) tied to the bottom around the main string (aram\u00e9). \u00a0It has three basic sounds, and is played with a combination of a large coin (or a flat rock, either of which is known as the dobrao) and a long stick (baqueta). \u00a0The person playing the berimbau will hold the entire instrument in his left hand by clutching the string holding the gourd to the instrument with his pinky, and clutching the main shaft of the instrument (the verga) with his ring and index fingers. \u00a0He&#8217;ll hold the dobrao in between his index finger and thumb, and use it to apply varying degrees of pressure to the aram\u00e9 in order to make different sounds when it&#8217;s hit with the baqueta. \u00a0The hand holding the baqueta often will also hold a small, wooden, woven container of beans called the caixixi, which will make sounds like a shaker with each hit of the baqueta. \u00a0The atabaque is analogous to the conga drum, and is a long wooden drum with a head of calfskin. \u00a0The pandeiro is simply a large tambourine. \u00a0These instruments form what is known as the bateria, or the band of instruments.</p>\n<p>The person holding the berimbau controls the flow of each jogo with his rhythm, and also typically leads everyone in song. \u00a0The atabaque then picks up after the rhythm of the berimbau, and the other instruments after that. \u00a0Everyone else claps in rhythm to the berimbau and sings the chorus of whatever song the bateria has started. \u00a0There are meaningful songs and nonsense songs. \u00a0There are songs for fast games and songs for slow ones. \u00a0Songs for men, songs for women, songs for birthdays, songs for deaths, songs for newcomers, and songs for farewells. \u00a0A clever berimbau player will link songs to different rhythms and events in the game. \u00a0If he&#8217;s particularly savvy, he might even start off the roda with a ladainha, which is a long solo at the very beginning of a roda which. \u00a0At its end, the capoeirista gives recognition to God (or a god), his mestre, whoever else he wants to give recognition to, and to capoeira itself. \u00a0If people get too far apart, he might start singing &#8220;jogo de dentro&#8221; to get them to play closer together. \u00a0If the roda is about to end, he might sing &#8220;para roda capoeira&#8221; as a send off.</p>\n<p>And there you have the bulk of it. \u00a0There will no doubt be more about capoeira on my page as time goes on, but I think that&#8217;s a pretty good primer to start with. \u00a0Here&#8217;s a video that I just love to watch which shows you a bit of it in motion (and actually is choreographed). \u00a0And before you ask, no, I am not nearly this polished.<br />\n<iframe

As such, even though they&#8217;re naturally opposed to being around one another, they&#8217;re able to overcome their mutual repulsion and <i>FUSE</i>\u00a0into a single, bare, deuterium nucleus. \u00a0In doing so, they spit out some antimatter (the antielectron), and a neutrino (which ends up escaping from the star very quickly). \u00a0This first step takes a dumb long time (~1 billion years), and produces about 0.42 MeV of energy. \u00a0The escaped antielectron will undoubtedly meet up with a normal electron and form a joint suicide pact, going on to release 1.02 MeV of energy. \u00a0The total produced in this step is ~1.44 MeV of energy, which corresponds to just about 2.3 x 10^(-13) Joules, or the amount of energy coming off of a 40-watt lightbulb in 5.75 femtoseconds.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.windows2universe.org/sun/Solar_interior/Nuclear_Reactions/Fusion/Fusion_in_stars/Animation/pp2.mpg\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Link for Helium-3 formation</a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Almost immediately (1 second) after that deuterium nucleus is formed, another proton that isn&#8217;t looking where it&#8217;s going just slams face (face?) first into it, creating a helium-3 nucleus, as well as producing about 5.5 MeV of energy. \u00a0You can see a schematic of this in the link above. \u00a0The yellow ball popping out is light in the form of gamma radiation.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0MnpKNjH_9I/UGYr8cTnd9I/AAAAAAAAAI8/wmWH50ycWY8/s200/H3_fusion.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"110\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The final product: raw uncut He-4.

I&#8217;m going to give the simplified version here. \u00a0Over the next million years, two helium-3 nuclei have a hell of a time smacking together to make helium-4, producing another 12.9 MeV of energy and two chaos-wreaking protons. \u00a0Altogether, this whole process produces about 27 MeV of energy. \u00a0That&#8217;s just about 4.3 x 10^(-12) Joules of energy.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><i>&#8220;Um&#8230;what gives? \u00a0I thought this process produced a star&#8217;s light. \u00a0It takes over a billion years and doesn&#8217;t make enough energy to power my TV!&#8221;</i> \u00a0Well maybe you should hush\u00a0and think for a second. \u00a0There&#8217;s more than just 6 damn protons in a star&#8217;s core right? \u00a0Right! \u00a0And all the light that&#8217;s produced at the surface has to come from these reactions in the core right? \u00a0Right! \u00a0So let&#8217;s be smart about this. \u00a0If we measure the brightness of a given star, let&#8217;s say our Sun for instance (~4 x 10^33 watts or Joules per second), we can extrapolate back to find out just how many times this is happening in the Sun&#8217;s core every second. \u00a04 x 10^33 Joules produced every second, and each process produces ~4 x 10^(-12) Joules. \u00a0That means that every second, this process is happening roughly 1 x 10^45 times in the Sun! \u00a0Yeah. \u00a0There&#8217;s a lot of protons in stellar cores.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>More massive stars still use the pp chain, but also get a significant contribution from the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycle. \u00a0Look on wikipedia for that. \u00a0I&#8217;m lazy, and there&#8217;s more to talk about than different methods of fusion.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fKWMaW9MQ0c/UGZBFWBOP2I/AAAAAAAAAJU/WqoBH2LH5Wg/s320/suninterior2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"316\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Radiative zone between the core and the convection zone</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Let&#8217;s keep looking into the interiors of these stars, and consider how all of this energy gets out. \u00a0Now, stars are all about energy transport. \u00a0You&#8217;ve got to get all of that energy that&#8217;s generated in the core out to the surface of the star somehow. \u00a0Typically, energy gets out from the core by scattering the light produced by fusion outward from particle to particle over ~10 million years (the figure changes depending on what type of star we&#8217;re talking about). \u00a0That scattering is demonstrated by the white path of photons in the picture above.</p>\n<p>However, with most stars, energy transport by outward scattering of radiation isn&#8217;t the most efficient method of transport throughout the entirety of the star. \u00a0And nature is nothing but efficient. \u00a0Always (he says as he remembers his appendix&#8230;). \u00a0Soooo&#8230;the star will instead turn to convection in order to transport energy outward. \u00a0HOW DOES THIS WOOOOOOORK!? \u00a0Consider a pot of boiling water.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eCJQR0-ZO6k/UGZHOeU8s9I/AAAAAAAAAJk/H0L3w72GLPM/s320/waterconvection.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"216\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Convection of the agua</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You put a pot of water on the stove and it&#8217;s cold. \u00a0You turn the stove on and the pot gets heated from below. \u00a0Now as we all know, hot water rises and cool water sinks. \u00a0So, hot bubbles created by the heating from below rise to the top of the water, reach the surface, release their heat (energy) to the air above, cool off, and sink back to the bottom where they&#8217;re heated again. \u00a0And thus the cycle continues. \u00a0This is what happens in stars, except instead of water it&#8217;s hot plasma rising and falling back into the star.</p>\n<p>Now, convection in low mass stars is interesting, as the location of the convective layer changes based on the mass of the star. \u00a0For stars with masses less than that of the Sun, the convective layer starts at the surface, and extends downward from there into the star as the mass of your star decreases. \u00a0Going upward from 1 solar mass, the convective layer starts at the core and grows outward with increasing mass. \u00a0This is illustrated in the graphic that I copied out of my notebook below.</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vrncTvoMVdE/UGZPYBx8NoI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/RSljQyWqXiI/s400/convectionschema.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ok so this is like the first science-ish plot to appear on this blog, so pay attention to it. m/M is the mass fraction of the star, and M/Mo is the actual mass of the star in solar masses. The shaded area is where convection occurs in the star, as a function of mass fraction and the overall mass of the star.</figcaption></figure>\n<div>\n<p>Why the division at 1 solar mass (oh geez oh geez the Sun is super duper extra special!)? \u00a0Well, for stars of less than one solar mass, their exteriors are really cool (temperature-wise). \u00a0In addition, the temperature of the star doesn&#8217;t drops off very steeply as you move from the core of the star to the surface of it. \u00a0As such, radiative energy transfer becomes very inefficient. \u00a0Convection on the other hand is more efficient (due to EQUATIONS that I&#8217;m too lazy show here), and thus the energy from the interior of the star gets transported outward via convection.</p>\n<p>With stars that are greater than 1 solar mass, the conditions are a bit different. \u00a0In these circumstances, the star&#8217;s interior is really really hot. \u00a0It&#8217;s so hot that the temperature toward the core of the star doesn&#8217;t decrease very sharply as you move outward in the star. \u00a0As such, the core transports energy outward via convective bubbles, until the temperature of the star starts to decrease sharply again with distance from the star&#8217;s center. \u00a0The hotter a star is in its interior, the farther out this convective layer extends.</p>\n<p>Alright. \u00a0That&#8217;s enough for now. \u00a0This was a huge information dump. \u00a0Until next time!</p>\n<p><i>Here are some non-wikipedia, non-class notes references that I may have stolen from for this post:</i></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/energy/ppchain.html\"><i>http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/energy/ppchain.html</i></a></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/heatra.html\"><i>http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/heatra.html</i></a></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><i>Disclaimer disclaimer, this is scientific musing at best. \u00a0This is not to be taken as a definitive source of information. \u00a0If anything, maybe just a primer. \u00a0But seriously though, learn this for yourself. \u00a0Don&#8217;t rely on me.

Mediocrity, <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mediocre\">by one definition</a>, means &#8220;of only ordinary or moderate quality; neither good nor bad; barely adequate.&#8221; By another definition, it means &#8220;not satisfactory; poor; inferior.&#8221; When mediocrity comes to mind, the latter meaning is what I envision. The thing about mediocrity is that once it&#8217;s accepted, it can go on to generate a trend in your life. Paraphrasing (as I don&#8217;t remember the exact verbage, only the gist of it) what my AP History teacher Mr. Burke had said to us roughly 10 years ago: you can be mediocre now, and go on to a mediocre school, get a mediocre job, a mediocre car, a mediocre house, a mediocre wife, and a mediocre life. And that&#8217;s fine, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re comfortable with.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<div align=\"LEFT\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">The reason why mediocrity is an issue for me, though, is that it&#8217;s REALLY BORING! Yes, you can live life sitting solidly in mediocrity, but what the hell is the point? What does it serve you to \u201cjust get by\u201d all the time? I&#8217;d rather live extraordinarily. In fact, that&#8217;s just about all that I respect and revere. Life is short, so why am I going to waste it by doing and witnessing the average? I want to see and do the spectacular, the passionate, the dynamic, and the strange.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div align=\"LEFT\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">That&#8217;s part of why I study what I study: the average for the Universe is the extraordinary when compared to what happens on Earth. That&#8217;s not even the whole of it though, because the physics that I study also applies to what we experience on Earth and makes that extraordinary. I guess what I really want is to see the extraordinary in existence. That seems truer to my desire. Physics and astronomy have given me the tools and the practice necessary to train my mind&#8217;s eye to see the world as more than just what it first appears to be. Yellow paint isn&#8217;t just yellow paint to me; yellow paint is a liquid composition of various atoms and molecules whose bonds are configured in such a way where that liquid absorbs the majority of all other visible radiation, but reflects wavelengths corresponding to the color yellow into my eye. That liquid itself is composed of billions of billions of billions (this is a low-ball estimate by the way) of atoms and molecules, all vibrating, rotating, stretching, and compressing, bouncing off of one another in a beautifully random dance. And each atom within those molecules is itself a universe of the extraordinary, with the individual physics governing each electron and each atomic nucleus. \u00a0The nucleus itself is further another realm of spectacular events, and all the way downward in scale. \u00a0All within yellow paint.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div align=\"LEFT\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">The ordinary&#8211;the mediocre&#8211;simply moves life forward to the next step. \u00a0The extraordinary&#8211;being the extraordinary, seeing the extraordinary, living the extraordinary&#8211;makes life worth living.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div align=\"LEFT\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">With that said, I leave you with a couple of quotes from books by the author of the quote at the top of the page, Alfred Bester. \u00a0He&#8217;s written two of my favorite books, and has a few things to say about greatness.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div align=\"LEFT\">\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIf a man&#8217;s got talent and guts to buck society, he&#8217;s obviously above average.

So, something appears &#8220;bluer&#8221; if it&#8217;s brighter in the blue filter than it is in the yellow-green filter. \u00a0This will make its B-V color negative, where more-negative means more-blue (mathematically, if it&#8217;s brighter in B than in V, then the object&#8217;s B magnitude will be smaller than the object&#8217;s V magnitude. \u00a0When you subtract the two, you&#8217;ll get a negative number. \u00a0Like 1 &#8211; 2 = -1). \u00a0On the contrary, if it is instead brighter in the yellow-green than it is in the blue, then we say that the object is &#8220;redder&#8221;, and it will have a positive B-V color. \u00a0That&#8217;s because its peak brightness occurs at longer wavelengths, with the longest of the visible wavelengths being in the red. \u00a0It&#8217;s all relative, much like temperature. \u00a0We&#8217;d say that a 90-degree day is &#8220;cooler&#8221; than a 110-degree day, even though 90 degrees is nowhere near being actually &#8220;cold&#8221; by our standards.</p>\n<p>Anyway, we organize stars in this way (magnitude vs. color) because stars tend to fall along pretty distinct tracks when we do. \u00a0What do I mean by that? \u00a0Well, check these labels out here in relation to where each subtype falls on the HR diagram (labeled HR diagram below this section; rest assured that each of these will have its own lengthy, long-winded blog post

Sequence:</b> Where stars of all types reside after their initial birth. \u00a0Stars on the Main Sequence will be fusing hydrogen into helium (by way of either <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_proton_chain\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">the p-p chain</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNO_cycle\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">the CNO cycle</a>) in their cores, much like <a href=\"http://rationalwhimsy.com/science-sunday-the-stars-part-i-introduction-to-shiny-things/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">our own Sun</a>. \u00a0Roughly about 10% of a star&#8217;s initial mass will be involved in fusion over its lifetime as a Main Sequence star, with 0.7% of that mass being converted into energy. \u00a0The length of this lifetime can be (roughly) derived by calculating the amount of mass that&#8217;s converted into energy and dividing it by the energy output by the star per year. \u00a0For the Sun, we have its *rough* initial mass of 2 x 10^30 kg. \u00a010% of that is 2 x 10^29 kg, and 0.7% \u00a0of THAT is \u00a01.4 x 10^27 kg. \u00a0If you convert mass into energy using that famous equation of Einstein&#8217;s: E = mc^2, you find that over the Sun&#8217;s main sequence lifetime, it&#8217;ll produce 1.26 x 10^44 Joules of energy. \u00a0For reference, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_the_United_States\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">the average energy consumption per year in the United States is 335.9 million BTUs per person</a>, which works out to about 3.54 x 10^11 Joules per person. \u00a0Since the US has roughly 314 million people, this rounds out to an annual energy consumption rate of about 1 x 10^20 Joules (or roughly a hundred billion billion Joules) per year. \u00a0If the Sun only produced as much energy as the United States consumed per year, it&#8217;d last for roughly 10^24 years, or 1 million billion billion years. \u00a0However the Sun produces about 4 x 10^26 Joules <b><i><u>per second</u></i></b> (4 million times the amount of energy we consume in a year). \u00a0This means about 1.26 x 10^34 Joules per year!. \u00a0If we divide the total energy production of the Sun in its lifetime (1.26 x 10^44 J) by this rate (1.26 x 10^34 J/year), we get out that the Sun should last about 10^10 years, or 10 billion years.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>The Subgiants: </b>Stars become subgiants when a) they are less than ~8 times as massive as our own Sun, <b><u>and</u></b> b) they have already run out of hydrogen fuel in their cores or are at the tail end of their hydrogen fusion. \u00a0The difference in b) is determined by how massive the star is initially. \u00a0In fact, what you&#8217;ll find out is that everything regarding a star&#8217;s evolution is determined by its initial mass and composition, but I digress. \u00a0If a star&#8217;s mass is above, say, a few solar masses, then its core will be depleted of hydrogen (filled now with inert helium) and contract. \u00a0This contraction will increase the temperature and density of the hydrogen gas around the helium core, and initiate hydrogen fusion in a thin shell around that core. \u00a0If instead a star has less than a few solar masses, it will forego an abrupt shutting-off of core fusion in lieu of a more gradual slow-down of core fusion, with some slower contraction of the core. \u00a0Overall, stars are in this phase before they jump into the Red Giant Branch.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b><a

</b>As the name implies, these stars are red and physically gigantic in size. \u00a0Not exactly rocket science right there. \u00a0Stars become red giants when they evolve out of the subgiant phase. \u00a0They&#8217;re earnestly fusing hydrogen in a thin shell around their inert helium cores, and fusing it at a higher temperature than they were in their Main Sequence phase. \u00a0Because the efficiency of hydrogen fusion is strongly dependent on temperature (~T^4, though not nearly as strongly dependent as helium fusion is!), the hydrogen-fusing shell outputs more energy than the hydrogen core used to. \u00a0This excess of energy pumps up the star&#8217;s luminosity by a factor of &gt;1,000! \u00a0This extra bit of luminosity makes the star really bloated and extends the hydrogen envelope of the star as well. \u00a0Because of the extended atmosphere, you have more light going over more surface area and over longer distances. \u00a0Due to many scatterings with atoms in the envelope over this distance, as well as something magnificent called convection, the emergent light is less-energetic than the light that emerges from the surface of Main Sequence stars. Thus, the star appears cooler, and redder. \u00a0Red star + big star = Red Giant!</li>\n<li><strong>The Horizontal Branch:\u00a0</strong>As the hydrogen shell in a red giant star continues to fuse, the helium products of that fusion get dumped onto the core of the star, which then contracts and heats up.\u00a0When the core temperature reaches 10^8 K (100 MILLION!), the helium core will ignite almost all at once, in what&#8217;s known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_flash\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">the helium flash</a>. During this time, the hydrogen-fusing shell is still in existence on top of the helium-fusing core. \u00a0However, when the core ignites, it will expand and thus greatly expand the hydrogen shell sitting above it, diminishing the fusing efficiency of that shell. \u00a0This decrease in luminosity will cause the size of the star to plummet (but not down to Main Sequence sizes). \u00a0As the star evolves through the Horizontal Branch, it will essentially maintain the same luminosity while growing progressively hotter (for reasons which I forget and are in my Stellar Interiors notes in my office). \u00a0This is the reason why it&#8217;s called the <i>horizontal</i>\u00a0branch; stars on this branch all have the same luminosity (again, essentially), but vary widely in temperature.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr03/images/agb_cutaway_big.gif\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.noao.edu%2Foutreach%2Fpress%2Fpr03%2Fimages%2Fagb_cutaway_big.gif&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"213\" border=\"0\" data-orig-src=\"http://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr03/images/agb_cutaway_big.gif\" /></a>The Asymptotic Giants:\u00a0</strong>As the star moves through helium fusion on the horizontal branch, it will of course drop the product of helium fusion deeper into its core. \u00a0In this case, the product is carbon. \u00a0So, carbon builds up in the core, and the helium core grows outward on top of the new carbon core. \u00a0Much like how the helium core was inert on the Red Giant branch, here the carbon core will be inert as it&#8217;s not hot enough to ignite. \u00a0Outside of the carbon core, you&#8217;ll have your helium shell fusing (more on this in a sec), and on top of THAT you have the hydrogen shell still plugging away. \u00a0When it&#8217;s in this <b>double-shell burning</b>\u00a0phase, it&#8217;s officially on the Asymptotic Giant branch. \u00a0This is the phase of utmost interest to me, because it&#8217;s a very dynamic phase of stellar evolution. \u00a0For one, the star is so bright and so extended that it&#8217;s actually losing a fair amount of its envelope via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">stellar winds</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_pulsations\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">stellar pulsation</a>. \u00a0This mass loss rate is sometimes as high as 10^(-4) solar masses per year (sometimes even higher!). \u00a0For reference, a solar mass is 2 x 10^33 grams, so 10^(-4) of that would STILL be like 2 x 10^29 grams every year. \u00a0EVERY YEAR! \u00a0That&#8217;s bananas! (<a href=\"http://youtu.be/QpgxnLlOt34\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">B-A-N-A-N-A-S!</a>) \u00a0For reference, the Earth is roughly 6 x 10^27 grams in mass. \u00a0This means that every year, these stars blow off more than 50 Earth&#8217;s worth of mass, just because they&#8217;re crazy like that. \u00a0The second dynamic bit is the fact that once the star is in this phase, it never quite reaches an equilibrium point again where it maintains some stable shape. \u00a0Its hydrogen outer shell dominates the energy output and increases the temperature and mass of the inner helium shell. \u00a0When enough matter and temperature have built up in the inner helium shell, it goes through a mini helium flash which we call a thermal pulse, and the star increases in brightness and size for a brief amount of time. \u00a0During this pulse outward, the hydrogen shell expands and effectively shuts off, until the helium shell dies down and contracts again. \u00a0After the contraction the hydrogen shell begins fusing again and the cycle restarts. \u00a0The time lag between successive pulses is on the order of 1,000 years (&#8220;on the order of&#8221; is astronomer-speak for &#8220;somewhere between one half of this number and 5 times this number&#8221;). \u00a0There&#8217;s another, short-term pulsation mechanism called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9A_mechanism\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">K-mechanism</a>, but I&#8217;ll leave that for another time.\n<p><a href=\"http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/bmendez/ay10/2000/cycle/whitedwarf.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcse.ssl.berkeley.edu%2Fbmendez%2Fay10%2F2000%2Fcycle%2Fwhitedwarf.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"258\" border=\"0\" data-orig-src=\"http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/bmendez/ay10/2000/cycle/whitedwarf.jpg\" /></a></li>\n<li><strong>The White Dwarfs:</strong>\u00a0<b> </b>The Asymptotic Giant branch represents the last phase of stellar evolution where you can still call the object a star. \u00a0After this point, the star will have puffed off its envelope through stellar winds and pulsations, leaving behind the white-hot carbon/oxygen core in the center of a brightly-shining <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">planetary nebula</a>. \u00a0This core is what we call the white dwarf. \u00a0This object is as hot as some of the hottest starts (recall, it came from the hot interior of an Asymptotic Giant) and has a mass comparable to our own Sun&#8217;s. However its size is about that of the Earth&#8217;s. \u00a0As you might imagine, this combination makes it a very dense object. \u00a0Simply based off of the information that I&#8217;ve given you here, you can derive just how dense this is (well, approximately anyway). \u00a0Let&#8217;s say that our white dwarf has a mass M of about 1 solar mass (2 x 10^33 grams), and a radius R equal to the Earth&#8217;s radius (about 6.4 x 10^3 km, so 6.4 x 10^8 cm). \u00a0First, we calculate the volume: V = (4/3)\u00a0\u03c0 R^3 = (4/3)\u00a0\u03c0 (6.4 x 10^8 cm)^3 = 1.1 x 10^27 cm^3. \u00a0Average density is defined as M/V, so the density of this white dwarf will be (2 x 10^33 g)/(1.1 x 10^27 cm^3) = 1.83 x 10^6 grams per cubic centimeter! \u00a0That is FREAKING absurd! \u00a0A cubic centimeter would be like the size of your pinky, halfway above the top knuckle. \u00a0In that small volume, a white dwarf would pack in 1.83 x 10^6 grams (or 1.83 x 10^3 kg, or 1.83 MEGAGRAMS!) of matter! \u00a0That&#8217;s nearly a third of the Earth&#8217;s mass on tip of your finger. \u00a0Crazy. \u00a0There&#8217;s other crazy stuff with white dwarfs, but I&#8217;ll get to that another time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They&#8217;re all grouped in these tracks on the HR diagram, all in relation to their temperatures (color) and brightnesses (magnitude).</p>\n<table class=\"tr-caption-container\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.pa.uky.edu/~shlosman/anim/HRdiaM15.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pa.uky.edu%2F~shlosman%2Fanim%2FHRdiaM15.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"406\" border=\"0\" data-orig-src=\"http://www.pa.uky.edu/~shlosman/anim/HRdiaM15.jpg\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tr-caption\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>An HR diagram depicting all the above-mentioned populations and more, with the source stellar cluster next to it. \u00a0For reference, this is M15, a globular cluster.</i></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ok so this post is going to be longer than I had originally anticipated, so I&#8217;m going to do the rest in later installments. \u00a0This should be enough now to get your astronomy juices flowing again though. \u00a0Note that there are hundreds of subtypes of stars, and I&#8217;ll try to get to those in the future. \u00a0Until next time!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif;\">*</span><i>Because I&#8217;m really just that lazy, all of my facts and figures either come from my faulty memory or from somewhere on the internets. \u00a0Conversions and calculations were done almost entirely on my iPhone, and may be a little (or a lot) off due to rounding and general laziness. \u00a0This is certainly not an ultimately-reliable source for facts and figures, just an astronomer rambling about stuff that gets him excited. \u00a0Enjoy for your own pleasure, but cite at your own peril! \u00a0In fact, seriously, don&#8217;t cite at all. \u00a0If you&#8217;re citing this as a source, you need some serious serious help.</i></p>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-18T02:47:05", "date_gmt": "2012-07-21T02:27:26", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=95", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=95", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/95"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/95/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:featuredmedia": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/96", "embeddable": true}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=95", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=95"}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>Oh snap!

Regardless of whether it&#8217;s repulsion or attraction, the strength of the force between the two charges increases as the amount (more negative or more positive) of either charge (charges q1 and q2) increases. \u00a0It also decreases as they get further apart.</p>\n<p><b>You Turn Me On With Your Electric Field</b></p>\n<p><b></b>Every electron existing somewhere sets up what&#8217;s called an <b>electric field </b>(from here on, called the E-field)<b>. \u00a0</b>The way to think about this is that the E-field is the area of influence of that electron. \u00a0If you had a stronger electric charge (say, TWO electrons *gasp*), then together they&#8217;d set up a stronger E-field (twice as strong, in fact). \u00a0Electric fields are typically shown in pictures as lines radiating away from some central charge, with arrowheads pointing toward the charge if it&#8217;s negative and away from the charge if it&#8217;s positive. \u00a0Therefore, a negative and positive charge together (in perfect harmony) set up an E-field like the one shown in the picture to the left. \u00a0For the sake of simplicity for later let&#8217;s imagine that \u00a0charges q1(+) and q2(-) are nailed in place, such that they set up an unchanging E-field. \u00a0This field, has some strength, <i>E</i>, based on the charges that set it up. \u00a0Ok. \u00a0That framework is set.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_83\" style=\"width: 289px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/espaciociencia.com_.wp-content.uploads.2009.10.dipol-thumb.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-83\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/espaciociencia.com_.wp-content.uploads.2009.10.dipol-thumb.jpg?resize=289%2C300\" alt=\"Oh, how pretty\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/espaciociencia.com_.wp-content.uploads.2009.10.dipol-thumb.jpg?resize=289%2C300 289w, http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/espaciociencia.com_.wp-content.uploads.2009.10.dipol-thumb.jpg?w=377 377w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oh, how pretty</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now, if you can, stretch your imagination to place a freely-moving third charge (q3 (+)) within our beloved E-field. \u00a0q3 experiences a force based on the strength of the E-field (surprised?), and the strength of q3, where the strength of the force on q3 increases if either the strength of the charge or the strength of the field increases. \u00a0The glorious thing about the field is that when q3 is placed within this field, it&#8217;ll move in whatever direction the field is pointing. \u00a0The amount of this movement, again, is dictated by the force it experiences within the field (and curiously enough, not the mass of the charged object). \u00a0Lovely.</p>\n<p><b>Word, You&#8217;re Not Confused Yet?

The way to think about it that makes the most sense is that <i>magnetic fields are emergent properties of electric fields when electric fields can&#8217;t keep still</i>. \u00a0An analogy that I find useful is that of a fan with lights on its fins (below). \u00a0When the fan is static, all that you see is lights on one of the fins. \u00a0However, when the fan is turned on and the fins start to spin, a pattern emerges that wasn&#8217;t there before. \u00a0The underlying structure of the fan with lights on the fins is the same, but in motion you get what appears to be a different phenomenon!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fanstationary.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-85\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fanstationary.jpg?resize=235%2C235\" alt=\"fanstationary\" srcset=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fanstationary.jpg?w=300 300w, http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fanstationary.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fanmotion.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-84 alignleft\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fanmotion.gif?resize=170%2C235\" alt=\"fanmotion\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n<p>Now that I see it, this is an almost perfect analogy, haha. \u00a0The same thing happens between electric and magnetic fields! \u00a0When you start spinning, shaking, oscillating (this becomes REALLY IMPORTANT), or otherwise changing E-fields, B-fields emerge. \u00a0B-fields can appear to be an entirely different phenomenon, but they&#8217;re really only the product of changing E-fields!</p>\n<p><b>And Now I Drop The Bomb on Your Brain Meats</b></p>\n<p>If you change an E-field at a constant rate, you set up a static B-field. \u00a0Now, if you change the RATE at which you&#8217;re changing your E-field, you change the B-field that you generate. \u00a0If you then change the rate at which you&#8217;re changing your B-field, you set up an E-field! \u00a0What?!

What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human nature acts as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives.&#8221;</p>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-18T02:12:29", "date_gmt": "2012-06-22T02:08:44", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=75", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=75", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/75"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/75/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=75"}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=75", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>I happened upon this quote during my current stay in Nashville at the Parthenon.

I had some preliminary thoughts to share about what might be called the &#8220;impostor complex&#8221; which you have described.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;\">I recently worked as a lab</span><span class=\"text_exposed_show\" style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0tech for six months, and I can say that if I never again work in such environs I will not miss it much. The reason is that one feels very small in the face of science. The compromise we make, as scientists, is that we can see ourselves as relevant to a given project, and if we can convince ourselves that that project is relevant to capital S science, then we can go on about our lives convinced that we are also relevant even as small cogs in a big machine. However, for those who are given to skepticism, simply the fact that our project exists, is endorsed by an enthusiastic PI, and is receiving funding sufficient to maintain the project is often not enough to convince us that said project is in fact relevant.</p>\n<p>As the world becomes more complex, particularly in fields such as yours which rely on huge amounts of data collection and analysis, where the limiting factor in many experiments is likely related to the organization of large amounts of data, a given person is likely to be so specialized that they feel overwhelmed, as you describe, by the huge amount that they don&#8217;t know. If this arrangement of division of labor works, we can rest assured that our own intellectual output is feeding into a kind of hive-mind-type structure which is working to create scientific conclusions of relevance. Therefore each individual inevitably feels somewhat alienated from the knowledge that they are, perhaps indirectly, involved in producing.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a quote that I like, which goes something like: &#8220;It is not enough for the fortunate man to simply be fortunate. He must also believe that he deserves his good fortune. Specifically, that he deserves his good fortune more than the next man.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Your impostor complex is kind of a backwards take on this quote, but it still proves that without belief in your own merit of your good fortune, you are somewhat unsettled.</p>\n<p>Nietzsche argued (to my understanding) that it was possible to become a superman through sheer human will power. That our capabilities are inherently endless, that we can as humans, perhaps within several generations, create the conditions in which we become perfectly suited for any given task of engineering or scholarship. I&#8217;m reaching here, because I haven&#8217;t really read nietzsche, but let&#8217;s let that stand as the idea of the &#8220;superman.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Modern people are inherently obsessed with the idea of the superman. We watch documentaries, CSI Las Vegas, Ultimate Fighting Championship, iron chef, and we get it in our head that people are out there doing great things because they have immense inherent talents and or have undergone unimaginably rigorous training programs. Most biographies of great authors or US presidents are self-consciously burdened with the task of explaining why a person stands out, what makes a given person, a successful person, so different from his peers. Consider the book &#8220;the outliers&#8221; for a good example of this post-facto analysis of exceptionalism.</p>\n<p>So we come away with the idea that there are these incredible people out there, who are inherently super-intelligent, or extremely diligent with the use of their time, or are given extraordinary abilities by their single-mindedness. And when we manage to break in and rub shoulders with the &#8220;elites&#8221; we experience a certain cognitive dissonance caused by the fact that we know that the confused spider&#8217;s web of concepts in our own mind does not resemble the well-tuned scientific process if we are truly among the elites. So either I am a fraud and the people around me understand everything much better than I do, or the people around me are pretending to understand everything but they are just as lost as I am. Or the projected image of who I am supposed to be, as a PhD in astronomy, is inherently unrealistic. Or there are just not that many people who are as diligent as I am about, say, astronomy, even though I play capoeira in the evenings and play video games and go clubbing on the weekends&#8230; even given those faults there are still not enough people who like astronomy and get up early in the morning enough to beat me at my game&#8230;</p>\n<p>So, I will posit to you that by and large the emperor (the academic ivory tower) has no clothes. As a society, we decide to set aside a certain amount of resources (I would probably argue, a pathetically small amount) for the pursuit of knowledge of the universe for its own sake. You have beaten out a high percentage of people in the game of merit that is played for those resources. You are correct in your suspicion that, just because you have proven a certain level of merit, does not mean that you will do anything great. Answering questions on a test goes a long way in securing your financial security and your funding as a scientist (not far enough, you would probably say). But it has very little bearing on whether or not you will actually be instrumental in doing what you have set out to do, which is discover something about the universe. Because the march of science, unlike the march of institutional academia, does not have checkpoints and endpoints pre-built into the system. It is pretty much chaos, everything is up for grabs. There is no merit-based system to determine what you will actually accomplish as a scientist.</p>\n<p>I feel like I&#8217;ve written a lot but said very little. \ud83d\ude42 Kudos to you on your QE&#8217;s.</span></p></blockquote>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-18T02:08:40", "date_gmt": "2012-06-20T02:07:05", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=73", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=73", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/73"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/73/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=73"}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=73", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>In response to a previous post of mine about my own experiences with the impostor phenomenon, a friend of mine, Joji Kojima, wrote this awesomeness that follows. \u00a0I definitely think it&#8217;s worth reading, and I&#8217;m still thinking about a worthy response to his wrote. \u00a0Anyway, here it is:</p>\n"}, "categories": [1], "tags": [35, 36, 31, 26], "guid": {"rendered": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/?p=73"}, "id": 73, "title": {"rendered": "Impostor Syndrome, Redux"}, "comment_status": "open", "author": 1, "modified_gmt": "2015-09-18T02:08:40", "meta": [], "sticky": false, "slug": "impostor-syndrome-redux", "template": "", "ping_status": "open"}, {"featured_media": 71, "format": "standard", "type": "post", "link": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/words-to-move-you-forward/", "date": "2012-06-19T02:05:06", "content": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Motivate-self.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-71\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Motivate-self.jpeg?resize=300%2C213\" alt=\"Motivate-self\" srcset=\"http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Motivate-self.jpeg?resize=300%2C213 300w, http://i2.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Motivate-self.jpeg?w=411 411w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>When I was studying for the Qualifying Exam, I oftentimes got down about my chances of success. \u00a0So, taking a note from some of the senior graduate students, I started seeking out and writing down words of inspiration. \u00a0While some of them are for me specifically, I figure that the majority of these might work for others as well. So, here they are:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>&#8211; You made it into grad school for a reason. Aside from the slight possibility that you were accepted based on race or personal connections, they would not have admitted you if they didn&#8217;t think that you could handle it and succeed. \u00a0You can do this.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Nick, the difference between who you are and who you want to be is set by what you do in your day-to-day. \u00a0You are working toward your goal diligently and consistently. \u00a0You will reap what you have sown: a carefree summer and a glorious 3rd year.</p>\n<p>&#8211; All of this science was figured out by people. \u00a0<i>People</i>. \u00a0Flawed, occasionally lazy, logical people that somehow found a pathway to understanding. \u00a0For every subject this pathway exists, and since you have the <u>same</u>\u00a0basic hardware that they had when they found the pathway, you can do it too. \u00a0This stuff isn&#8217;t beyond you. \u00a0It might currently be <i>just</i>\u00a0out of reach, but it is not beyond you. \u00a0Stretch the limits of yourself and take hold of what you want. \u00a0It can, and it will, be yours.</p>\n<p>&#8211; You can rise to this challenge, Nick. \u00a0It&#8217;s like Mangang\u00e1 said: Proper Preparation Prevents Passive Poor Performance. \u00a0Actually, let&#8217;s add to that: Proper Preparation, Perseverance, and Patience Prevent Passive Poor Performance.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Keep dad&#8217;s words in your mind at all times: Take the time to do it right. \u00a0Go. \u00a0Go now and fucking do it!</p>\n<p>&#8211; Being defeated is often a temporary condition. \u00a0Giving up is what makes it permanent.</p>\n<p>&#8211; There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.</p>\n<p>&#8211; The pain of discipline is far less than the pain of regret.</p>\n<p>&#8211; When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you&#8217;ll be successful (from one of my <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">favorite videos on YouTube</a>).</p>\n<p>&#8211; Work on your weaknesses until they are strengths, and work on your strengths until they are second nature.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Knowing is not enough, we must apply. \u00a0Willing is not enough, we must do.</p>\n<p>&#8211; It doesn&#8217;t matter when you started. \u00a0It doesn&#8217;t matter how long it took. \u00a0It doesn&#8217;t matter how many times you failed. \u00a0All that matters is that you <i>finished</i>\u00a0what you started.</p>\n<p>&#8211; You <i>must</i>\u00a0do the things you think you can <b>not</b>\u00a0do. \u00a0Keep your head up and your heart strong.</p>\n<p>&#8211; You are in charge of how you feel, and today, choose &#8220;motivated&#8221; and &#8220;accomplished&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8211; Just keep moving forward and don&#8217;t give a shit about what anybody thinks. \u00a0Do what you have to do, for you.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Months of discipline, or a lifetime of unhappiness? \u00a0You pick.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Don&#8217;t let one bad day kill your confidence and progress.</p>\n<p>&#8211; If you like progress, try patience. \u00a0If you like change, try keeping at it.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Strength doesn&#8217;t come from what you<i><b>\u00a0</b>can</i>\u00a0do. \u00a0It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>&#8211; You can feel burnt-out tomorrow or you can feel like a failure come June 13th (the qual date). \u00a0You choose.</p>\n<p>&#8211; If you don&#8217;t want to be\u00a0like everyone else, then you have to be willing to do things differently.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Start by doing what is necessary. \u00a0Then, do what is possible. \u00a0Suddenly, you&#8217;ll find you&#8217;re doing the impossible.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Don&#8217;t be upset with the results you <b>didn&#8217;t get</b>\u00a0from the work that you<b>\u00a0didn&#8217;t do.</b></p>\n<p><b><br />\n</b>&#8211;

I took the longest, most intense, high-stress exam in my life thus far\u2014the Qualifying Exam.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Two days later, I found out the results of that exam. I passed, apparently without a bit of of debate. \u00a0I officially became Nicholas Hunt-Walker, Master of Astronomy.</p>\n<p>I think the news of my success still has yet to fully hit me. \u00a0Honestly, I have a hard time believing that it&#8217;s actually true\u2014that I managed to pass the qualifying exam at the &#8220;doctoral&#8221; level. \u00a0The first thoughts that come to mind even now are, &#8220;how is this even possible? \u00a0Are they sure that they graded the exam correctly? \u00a0Knowing what I know about astronomy, there&#8217;s no real way in which I could be viable to move forward to the next stage in my graduate career.&#8221;</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not as if I hadn&#8217;t made a serious attempt to prepare for it. \u00a0Any one of my friends (hell, even my recent ex-girlfriend) could be asked about the extent of my prep work, and they&#8217;d be able to confidently rattle off some double-digit number of hours per week that I had spent working toward this goal. \u00a0There was rarely a day that wasn&#8217;t spent studying, and those that weren&#8217;t were spent working in some capacity so that I&#8217;d have more time later TO STUDY. \u00a0Weekends became cherished not for breaks from work, but for opportunities to study without daily interruptions. \u00a0Evenings became working nights, where I could let the Sun drop below the horizon while I tried to fill my brain to capacity with facts about the universe. \u00a0Meals became brief breathers between pages of my notes. \u00a0The few hours where my mind wasn&#8217;t occupied with thoughts of astronomy (or imminent failure and the consequences of it) could be counted amongst hours of sleep and&#8230;physical recreation (capoeira being one of my principal physical outlets). \u00a0As time went on, even that decompression time became shorter and shorter. \u00a0I say all that to say that, intellectually, I know that I put in the hours.</p>\n<p>However, when I reflect on my knowledge of astronomy and astrophysics, it doesn&#8217;t seem to be sufficient. \u00a0The volume of information that I&#8217;ve packed into my skull seems underwhelming when I think about what it should take in order to qualify as a true Ph.D. candidate. \u00a0Yes I know some things about planets, stars, galaxies, and the universe as a whole. \u00a0I know about some of the astrophysics of the universe, and can tell you any number of things about the mechanics of the universe and the little bits within. \u00a0Hell, even if I don&#8217;t know explicitly what physical laws a particular phenomenon might follow, I can probably make some sensible assumptions about how it might work and derive my way toward something resembling the truth. \u00a0But&#8230;I don&#8217;t know. \u00a0Master of Astronomy? \u00a0It just&#8230;doesn&#8217;t quite seem to fit.</p>\n<p><b><br />\nThis, however, is not a new feeling.</b></p>\n<p>Ever since I had begun taking graduate classes at the University of Washington, I&#8217;ve felt a little out of place. \u00a0This is not because of any deficiency in the astronomy department, I just felt a little behind the pace of my peers locally and nationally. \u00a0My years of intellectual training seemed to fail me, as I wasn&#8217;t always able to calculate or make conceptual connections as quickly as most of my classmates. \u00a0Long and involved derivations seemed to loom before me like dark, foreboding mountains in the distance, insurmountable with whatever I had been equipped with. \u00a0And forget about anything computational. \u00a0Everyone else seemed to see coding instructions as sensible and straight forward, while I always felt like I might as well have been trying to build a fusion reactor with instructions written in Sanskrit (damn you Hydrodynamics!).<br />\nWith these feelings in my gut, as well as the apparently tangible examples of my incompetence (I never did figure out that shock tube&#8230;), I couldn&#8217;t imagine how I&#8217;d make it in this field. \u00a0Never mind all of what I had managed to retain from my classes, and all the moments where my undergraduate training actually served to demonstrate my conceptual understanding. \u00a0Every success was merely me doing what it was that I was supposed to do. \u00a0Every misstep seemed to be the stumbles of someone walking in shoes made for someone else&#8217;s feet.</p>\n<p><b><br />\nI was in a seat meant for someone else.</b></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/magazine/20060901/handson-leadership.html\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">impostor phenomenon</a> is characterized by an individual&#8217;s inability to internalize their accomplishments. \u00a0Instead, the individual feels like any success that they have thus far experienced has been a function of the circumstances, pure luck, pity, or some inexplicable blindness in those evaluating their ability. \u00a0Worse yet, the individual oftentimes feels perpetually fearful of their perceived incompetence being uncovered and that they&#8217;ll be exposed as the fraud that they &#8220;truly&#8221;

The two eternal partners lie within a circle, which itself <a href=\"http://taoism.about.com/b/2008/04/02/the-yin-yang-symbol.htm\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">apparently represents the Tao (or Dao)</a>. \u00a0I just learned of this today while reading about it! \u00a0It&#8217;s interesting, because I&#8217;ve never once actually noticed the circle being as a distinct component of the whole symbol. I just always took it for granted as being a part of the symbol itself and that the yin and yang together make a circular figure. \u00a0This is even more interesting to me, as the tao itself (as I have interpreted it) is at its base naturally that way: it&#8217;s not a distinct part of the world, it simply represents everything that is. \u00a0Here we have the same trend\u2014the circle isn&#8217;t really a distinct part of the symbol. \u00a0It simply just IS the symbol, within which yin and yang dance their way through creation and destruction.</p>\n<table

\u00a0\u00a0 In all the years that I spent drawing yin-yangs on various media, I never once suspected that it had partners. \u00a0However it does, and I first noticed the existence of these trigrams while watching the popular anime series <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Naruto</a>. \u00a0To be briefish about it, Naruto is a story about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">ninjas</a>, friendship, and the turbulent, militaristic world within which they all live. \u00a0Within this world, there are adults and kids practicing various types of jutsu (ninja-related martial arts and what is essentially magic) of which there are three types: <b>ninjutsu</b> (the tangible &#8220;magic&#8221; component to the series utilizing one&#8217;s internal energy, or their chakra, to manifest changes in the physical world), <b>genjutsu</b> (types of mind control that, while not tangible, are still quite devastating), and <b>taijutsu</b> (various styles of hand-to-hand combat). \u00a0Amongst the taijutsu users there are two general schools: Strong Fist users (most people) and Gentle Fist users (a very select group). \u00a0Strong Fist users employ hard punches, kicks, and other physical techniques with the purpose of causing great external, visible damage (e.g. broken bones, dislocated joints, knock outs). \u00a0Conversely, Gentle Fist users practice what looks like combative Tai Chi, and use a combination of precise, flowing, open-hand strikes and focused amounts of chakra to cause great internal damage (e.g. damaging internal organs, blood flow, chakra flow).</p>\n<figure style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img

Chi and developed a technique called the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms technique (<i>Hakke Rokujuuyonshou</i>). \u00a0When he performs this technique, a projection of the taijitu and ba gua appears beneath him, and if his target is within the range encompassed by that circle he proceeds to thoroughly rock their shit (<a href=\"http://youtu.be/57XY93oOLac?t=6s\"

interesting. \u00a0What are those symbols around that yin-yang? \u00a0Is that some taoist thing?&#8221; \u00a0From there I abused Google, as is my nature, and through various jumps of topics found out quite a bit which I had not known before.</p>\n<p>I first found out that these symbols were called the ba gua. \u00a0I further found that the\u00a0symbols each had names and that these names had different associations depending on the system with which you&#8217;re defining your taijitu+ba gua combination. \u00a0The one seen above is the King Wen (Later Heaven) system, while the other one that I know of (all praise and honor is to Wikipedia) is the Fuxi (Earlier Heaven) system. \u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_gua\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">According to

<b>TRI</b>gram), where each part is <a href=\"http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/Chinese_Customs/bagua.htm\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">a broken (representing yin) or solid (yang) line</a>. \u00a0Here, we see where the various combinations of yin and yang producing the different components of nature, people, and existence in general. \u00a0Why it&#8217;s only 3 lines per ba gua symbol is beyond me, but that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s done. \u00a0Maybe as I read more about this and taoism (which is another article in and of itself), I&#8217;ll learn why.</p>\n<p>On top of all of THAT, the eight trigrams can be configured together into 64 more combinations called hexagrams (probably why the technique is called Eight Trigrams 64 Palms Technique, but I digress), each representing a different philosophical concept. \u00a0I won&#8217;t list them all here, but I will provide a link (<a href=\"http://www.iching123.com/64_hexagrams_chart_text.htm\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">link</a>). \u00a0Together with the ba gua and the taijitu, you have all of life, the Universe, and everything.</p>\n<p>I think that I&#8217;ll end this already-lengthy article right here, as I&#8217;ve hit what I consider to be the major points of what I&#8217;ve learned about yin and yang. \u00a0In the future, I hope to explore more about these symbols, the various ba gua configurations, taoism, and zen in general. \u00a0Maybe, with all of these at my back, I can move one step closer towards true understanding of existence and peace.</p>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t that what we all want anyway?</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://www.energyenhancement.org/testimonial_pics/ZenCircle01.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\"

a week and a half it will have been 2 years since I first began to practice capoeira. \u00a0It&#8217;s amazing that this activity has become such a large part of my life, especially considering how before that moment I hadn&#8217;t thought about capoeira outside of <a href=\"http://youtu.be/yhp-TyRJGUc\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">video games</a> and <a href=\"http://youtu.be/iQzT7CHHVEk\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">movies</a>. \u00a0Even then, while I thought it looked cool, I only really thought of it as sort of a quaint novelty. \u00a0Knowing absolutely nothing about the style, I had thought it impractical for real-world fighting scenarios, and entirely too filled with unnecessary movements to be useful before the practitioner exhausted himself. \u00a0Then came February of 2010.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><!--more--></p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a

data-blogger-escaped-style=\"clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;\">Between the fall of 2009 and summer of 2010 I had been employed at Columbia University as a post-baccalaureate student in the department of Astronomy. \u00a0Late into the fall of 2009, I had broken up with my girlfriend at the time (who I&#8217;m with now) and had since found someone else that had captured my interest. \u00a0I would make any excuse that I could to spend time with her, if only to keep myself on her mind and maybe find a way to capture her interest. \u00a0Heh, I&#8217;ve never really been good at the whole &#8220;courting&#8221; thing, so that was the only strategy that I had. \u00a0Anyway, one of the ways, that I would try to spend time with her was to go to the gym with her twice per week. \u00a0The Columbia gym (the Dodge Fitness Center) is an indoor gym extending underground, with several facilities, individual workout rooms, and an indoor track which tours the upper level of the complex and passes some of the aforementioned workout rooms.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">Once inside the gym, we&#8217;d go our separate ways but we&#8217;d meet up after our respective workouts to jog around for a bit on the track. \u00a0About two years ago on a Tuesday at the beginning of February (2/2/2010 in fact), we had been jogging around the track when my ears picked up on the sound of drums. \u00a0Being the black man that I am, the drums stirred something within me, compelling me to follow their sound back to their source. \u00a0So, I said to my lovely companion, &#8220;hey, drums! \u00a0Wanna see where they&#8217;re coming from?&#8221; \u00a0She complied, and we proceeded toward one of the workout rooms in the back. \u00a0As we approached, I peered through the glass window and saw people dressed in all white with their shoes off, some with colorful ropes around their waists, performing those same movements that I had seen in video games and movies so long ago; the movements of capoeira.</p>\n<p>As we stood outside the door to the room and watched, one of the capoeiristas came over and beckoned us to join them inside. \u00a0Apparently this was their first class of the semester, and was serving as an introductory class for those that were interested. \u00a0As such, the class was split up: on the left side of the room were the newbies (dressed in whatever workout clothes they were wearing) and on the right side were the people who had been there before (most of which were wearing all-white with various colored cords around their waists). \u00a0So, we drifted over to the left side of the class and ran through a few of the basic movements. \u00a0We learned how to perform and pronunce the names of ginga (everyone looks stupid when they begin. \u00a0I still look pretty stupid), martelo, meia lua de frente, esquiva de frente, esquiva lateral, negativa, rol\u00ea, and a\u00fa. \u00a0None of this was easy to do, and I really hated looking like a doofus in front of the girl I was interested in, as well as in general, but it was definitely fun.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of class, everyone in the room joined up into a large circle. \u00a0The instructor, Contramestre George Palmares, briefly spoke to us (I forget about what) and then began to start what I would later come to know as the <i>roda</i>. \u00a0Some instruments were brought out in addition to the drum that was out before, and some of the students left the circle to man those instruments. \u00a0These were the <a href=\"http://www.colorado.edu/StudentGroups/CapoeiraAngola/berimbau.gif\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">berimbau</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sultansound.com/pandeiro.jpg\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">pandeiro</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.gope.net/Produtos/AtabaqueCordas.jpg\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">atabaque</a>, comprising the basic components of the\u00a0<i><a href=\"http://www.ele-mental.org/capoeira/TABCAT/images/TABCATroda0411-bateria.jpg\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">bateria</a>, </i>or the percussion band that commands the roda (other instruments include, but are not limited to: the <a href=\"http://www.expobrazil.com/en/fotos/prd2132.jpg\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">agogo</a>\u00a0and the <a href=\"http://www.start-playing-capoeira.com/images/Reco-Reco-Parts.jpg\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">reco-reco</a>). \u00a0Then the bateria began to play. \u00a0The music began with the odd, rhythmic <i>twang</i> of the single-stringed berimbau. \u00a0This was joined by the pandeiro, whose mini-cymbals filled the room with a light-hearted shake, punctuated every so often with an abrupt SLAP upon its center. \u00a0Bringing up the rear was the atabaque, whose bass and hypnotic sound filled the room and moved my soul.</p>\n<p>Once the instruments had started up, capoeiristas around the roda began to clap 1-2-3, 1-2-3, led by the rhythm strung out on the berimbau. \u00a0As quickly as the music had begun, a microcosm was created in which all the capoeiristas were focused on the roda and the music, seeming to share a common essence (ax\u00e9?) with the external world fading away. \u00a0Two capoeiristas entered the roda at the foot of the bateria, crouched, and waited for the berimbau player to let them know when it was time to play a game. \u00a0Then, a call-and-response song started up, led by the berimbau player. \u00a0I forget which song it was exactly, but if I were to guess, it probably would have been&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p>Luanda \u00e9 meu boi / Luanda \u00e9 para / Tereza canta sentado / Oi Marina samba de p\u00e8 / La no cais da

regular text would be what the main guy said, and the bold italicized text would be how we all responded. \u00a0While clapping. \u00a0It was difficult to sing a new song and clap at the same time without sounding like a complete idiot (and I&#8217;m sure I sounded like that) or screwing up the rhythm (it still is quite difficult) but I gave it a shot anyway. \u00a0It was my first introduction to the base teaching method of capoeira: I do x, you attempt to follow x until you can actually follow x.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>As we sang and clapped, and tried not to embarrass ourselves, the two players at the foot of the bateria cartwheeled in and began to play (in capoeira we don&#8217;t fight, we play). \u00a0Kicks flew left and right, bodies rose, fell, and rotated, the players swayed from here to there, and all of this was done to the rhythm of the berimbau. \u00a0After each game had gone on for a little while, maybe 45 seconds to a minute, one of the capoeiristas standing on the rim of the roda next to the bateria would crouch down at the foot of the bateria and then take their turn playing the person who had been in the roda the shortest. \u00a0I later learned that this was called &#8220;buying&#8221; the game. \u00a0So, games were bought and people played, songs were sung, and fun was had by all. \u00a0I think that I even played, though I can&#8217;t exactly remember if I had. \u00a0If I did play though, I was most definitely an uncoordinated mess.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>After some time, the class approached its end. \u00a0The roda games ended, the instruments were put to rest, and we once again all gathered on the rim of the roda. \u00a0George said a few more words, let us know that this was a trial class for those who might be interested in capoeira, then ended the class by having us come together and give a big &#8220;Capoeira Guerreiros! \u00a0Salv\u00e9!&#8221; before dispersing. \u00a0Thus was my first introduction to capoeira through the Columbia University branch of the Newark, NJ-based Capoeira Guerreiros, led by a very tall Brazilian man that I came to know as contramestre George Palmares.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>After that first class, everything on my body was pain incarnate. \u00a0My legs, my arms, my ass, my back, my chest, my abs, my shoulders, my neck, my palms, my wrists, my feet; they were all either in pain or too fatigued to be of any real use. \u00a0The bottoms of my feet were torn up and stinging from friction against the hard wood floors. \u00a0My legs were jelly from the ginga and the constant movement. \u00a0My body was little more than a stinging meat bag with limbs. \u00a0Even though by the end of that first class I had been thoroughly exhausted from the workout and embarrassed from having looked like a complete and utter fool, with the next few days finding my body to be akin to a rag doll, after that first day I was hooked.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>I spent the next couple of months training every Tuesday and Thursday night with Guerreiros, learning and refining techniques, songs, mind-body coordination, and the etiquette of the martial art through a combination of direct instruction and my own inquiry. \u00a0I kept trying to get the girl I had originally brought with me to join me, and she did indeed come by a few times. \u00a0However, it wasn&#8217;t for her and I could see that after a few times, and so after awhile I simply stopped putting on that pressure. \u00a0It was an activity that was for me; something that was my own to have and to enjoy. \u00a0I quickly developed the feeling that to treat capoeira like some obligation or some chore that you had to get through during the week was to do a disservice to yourself and to the martial art. \u00a0The people that were in the group that practiced consistently felt similarly, and I soon began to become friendly with some. \u00a0There were a few that had started with me that managed to stay on. \u00a0If memory serves me, their apelidos (capoeira nicknames) were Panda, Coqueiro, and A\u00e7ucena. \u00a0There were also a few that had been there a little while longer that I would train with often; two of whose apelidos were Jesus and Doutor. \u00a0I actually never received an apelido from Guerreiros, as they could never figure out what to call me (though I think by default a few of my instructors settled on what sounded like\u00a0<i>negho,</i>\u00a0spelled &#8220;<i>neg\u00e3o&#8221;,\u00a0</i>portuguese-ish for &#8220;big black guy&#8221; &lt;= the nice way of putting it). \u00a0I eventually got one from another group, but I&#8217;ll get to that later.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure id=\"attachment_51\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a

George to his left.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>During class we&#8217;d all practice together, two-by-two, and play together in the roda. \u00a0I showed some natural ability with a few techniques (really anything that called for agility or power, like a\u00fa or front hand springs), and through boldness (or stupidity; the jury&#8217;s still out on that one) was able to learn a few advanced sequences and movements from watching and copying some of the older students. \u00a0I&#8217;d be my naturally shy self, preferring to listen and watch far more than speaking and acting, though my classmates and the instructors would slowly get me to open up. \u00a0I remember some classes where we&#8217;d practice headstands on gym mats, and while I could do them pretty well (mom had us doing yoga at a young age) I&#8217;d often feel embarrassed at the oil from my dreads being left behind on the mats. \u00a0Some classes we&#8217;d line up at one end of the room and move forward in rows of 2 doing various movements or little sequences, looking like an army in training. \u00a0During other classes, we&#8217;d set up chairs in the middle of the room and practice kicking over them while facing a partner and a\u00fa-ing (cartwheeling) over to the next chair. \u00a0Our instructors would switch from class to class, I suppose depending on who George could get to teach that day. \u00a0Sometimes it was George, sometimes George and the dude he called his &#8220;brother&#8221;, Omi (it was about a year before I realized that Omi was not his biological brother. \u00a0Yes, I am working toward my doctorate in science. \u00a0Why do you ask?). \u00a0Sometimes it&#8217;d be Papito (who was a task master!) either alone or with others. \u00a0From time to time we&#8217;d even have Sonic (from Senzala) come by with his crazy ass. \u00a0We&#8217;d train and practice and train and practice and sing and play and it was all good and fun.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>While I don&#8217;t remember the exact day that I got my abadas (all-white capoeira clothes), I do remember the happiness and pride that I felt when I received them. \u00a0They gave me a sense of identity with the group; a feeling that I was more than just some dude who practiced with them\u2014I was one of them. \u00a0I especially liked the distinctive yellow band around the hips.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"separator\">The first outing that I had gone to with members of Capoeira Guerreiros took place at this bar/restaurant near Columbia called Campo. \u00a0I forget exactly where this occurred in my capoeira timeline, but it was definitely within those first few months before May 2010, as it was sort of a fundraiser for an upcoming event (it might even have taken place the night before the batizado&#8230;hmm&#8230;.). \u00a0So, after class, several of us went to Campo where there was an area in the back that was cleared out for the Capoeira Guerreiros cohort. \u00a0The few of us that were coming from Columbia arrived early, so we kinda just lounged around until the main crew arrived from Jersey. \u00a0It was during this waiting time that I had my first <a href=\"http://media.cocktailia.com/2007/10/caipirinha.jpg\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">caipirinha</a>\u00a0(heaven in a glass. That&#8217;s not a translation. \u00a0It&#8217;s actually heaven in a glass.). \u00a0It was a little awkward because I was still in my shy phase and was more or less afraid to talk to people, so I continued to wait with the people that I did recognize until the Newark crew began to trickle in. \u00a0As they did, we set up the instruments, changed into our capoeira clothes, and the party got started.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\">It was so awesome! \u00a0We took over the whole bar, played some games in the bar, and even had some people show off some acrobatics amongst the dimmed light and loud music. \u00a0I played in my work clothes, and even managed to dance a bit. \u00a0I had invited the girl from earlier to come with me, and she had a pretty good time too. \u00a0All the guys wanted to dance with her, and she got to shake her ass every which way. \u00a0I have to admit I was definitely keeping an eye out because I still wanted to lay some claim, but not too much because I had my own dancing to do. \u00a0I was amazed to see people playing capoeira after drinking <i>several</i>\u00a0drinks, but they did (and didn&#8217;t even throw up! That in itself is amazing!). \u00a0It was a great and fun night for all involved.</p>\n<div>\n<p>The above was a very successful fundraiser for what is known as the capoeira batizado (pronounced &#8220;ba-chi-ZAH-dooh&#8221;; Portuguese for &#8220;baptism&#8221;), which for us would occur in late April. \u00a0The batizado (in my very limited experience) is an event where capoeiristas from all around the world come together for various celebrations, with the main celebration being that of the induction of new members into the world of capoeira via the baptism of the foot. \u00a0When I had first heard about this event, I really didn&#8217;t know what to think. \u00a0There was never really a formal session to introduce me to batizados, so it was a complete mystery to me. \u00a0I just knew that it would be big and that it was important for me to attend if I had hoped to continue practicing capoeira. \u00a0So, I invited a few of my friends, my parents, and my new-old girlfriend (the one I had broken up with before), and went to my first batizado.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The Spring 2010 Columbia University Capoeira Guerrieros Batizado was held (primarily) inside of the Columbia University Dodge Fitness Center, the big underground gym where we had all of our practices. \u00a0However, instead of being confined to a small room in the back of the gym, we occupied the center floor at the very bottom. \u00a0Looking up, one would see rings on top of rings of levels of the gym, with various people doing various workouts. \u00a0Because the students in attendance at the batizado were comprised not only of the Columbia branch of Guerreiros, but also from other capoeira schools in and around the NY area, as well as other Guerreiros branches along the east coast, there were capoeiristas in every direction. \u00a0As we entered, we changed into our white shirts and our white pants with the yellow band, and were told to get on the floor and warm up. \u00a0Thus it had begun.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<table class=\"tr-caption-container\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f8G9BvA67Dc/TyDMMdH7JXI/AAAAAAAAAEg/k7GMqVKEd-E/s1600/GEDC0511.JPG\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f8G9BvA67Dc/TyDMMdH7JXI/AAAAAAAAAEg/k7GMqVKEd-E/s400/GEDC0511.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tr-caption\"><i>A shot of some of the Guerreiros students on the gym floor.<br />\nWe all wore white until they actually gave us blue shirts.</i></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div>\n<p>OK, that last bit might be a bit of an embellishment on my part, as I actually arrived a little bit late and missed one of the morning workshops (I&#8217;m not and have never been a morning person). \u00a0You see, the batizado was an all-day event, running from about 8am until (and beyond) 5pm. \u00a0Each hour was packed with a different workshop or other activity. \u00a0Some capoeiristas were brought in to teach advanced movements and sequences, while others gave instruction on dancing and music. \u00a0The workshops ran the gamut of what I knew at the time to represent capoeira, and they ran all day until the main event.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o4GFTjQXEM0/TyDWzWhYn5I/AAAAAAAAAEo/2IYOCk0sWE4/s1600/GEDC0512.JPG\"><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o4GFTjQXEM0/TyDWzWhYn5I/AAAAAAAAAEo/2IYOCk0sWE4/s320/GEDC0512.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<div>\n<p>The main event had us form a huge roda, filled with far more people than are seen in the above photograph (many trickled in late; what is it about minorities and punctuality? \u00a0Smh&#8230;). \u00a0Represented (as far as I know) were Guerreiros from Columbia U.,; Newark, NJ; Montclair, NJ; and some senzalites (senzaleiros? senzaliens?) from Mestre Zumbi&#8217;s school in NY; amongst many others who I&#8217;ve never known or met again. \u00a0We all changed into our blue shirts (special for the batizado!), and formed up into the roda. \u00a0The bateria players got their chairs, their instruments, and their different berimbaus (gunga, medio, viola), and waited for it all to begin. \u00a0The first bit was an open roda, meaning that whoever wanted to buy in could buy in and play. \u00a0I got to watch some pretty amazing games (I was blown away at the time) between some very experienced people, including but not limited to Mestre Zumbi and George.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Once those preliminary festivities were over, the actual induction part of the batizado began. \u00a0This is where each student would be &#8220;tested&#8221; against someone that&#8217;s far more experienced, and after being tested they&#8217;d obtain a new colored rope, called a corda, to wear around their waist. \u00a0The type of cord they were being tested for would determine how many people they&#8217;d be tested against, as well as how they&#8217;d be tested. \u00a0Beginners would have to face only one person, while some of the more advanced capoeiristas would have to go against 3 or 4 (or more) people consecutively. \u00a0The cord system for Guerreiros follows the colors of the Brazilian flag, with light green signifying a fresh-off-the-press beginner. \u00a0It then continues to deep green &gt; deep green + yellow &gt; yellow &gt; yellow + blue &gt; blue &gt; green + yellow + blue &gt;\u00a0green + yellow + blue + white &gt; green + white &gt; yellow + white &gt; blue + white &gt; white (for mestre).</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The interesting thing about my test was that I wasn&#8217;t aware that I was allowed to attack back. \u00a0I thought it was a &#8220;survive if you can, FOOL!&#8221; situation! \u00a0Therefore, when it was my turn to go up I spent the entire time dodging. \u00a0Esquiva &gt; negativa &gt; rol\u00ea, esquiva &gt; negativa &gt; rol\u00ea, a\u00fa, a\u00fa, duck, dodge, move to the side. \u00a0If you were to hear my thoughts, they probably would have sounded something like: &#8220;Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! \u00a0What do I do?! Don&#8217;t get hit! \u00a0What do I do?! Don&#8217;t get hit! \u00a0Get out the way! Shit! Shit! Shit!&#8221; \u00a0At some point, for whatever reason, I decided to go in for a head-butt (cabe\u00e7ada), only to meet my opponent&#8217;s elbow. \u00a0He then prepared to drop me, but showed mercy and ended the game. \u00a0You can see it all below [<i>video dead for some reason</i>].</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Once I had finished embarrassing myself, flailing about, and getting my ass kicked all over the roda, I was awarded a light-green cord and officially recognized as a student of Capoeira Guerreiros. \u00a0Following my test, other students from my cohort went for their cords. \u00a0Then some of the advanced students had their multiple-opponent tests. \u00a0All of that had been completed, the roda began to get far more lively.\u00a0 Instead of the traditional system of a single game per roda, the super-roda housed 3 simultaneous games! \u00a0It was quite the spectacle.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>It was interesting trying to play in the roda with two other games going on. \u00a0Not only did I have to focus on my own game, but it was necessary to be mindful of the other two games around me as well. \u00a0 While I&#8217;m trying to go for a compasso, someone else might just be landing from a parafuso, and a third person might be tumbling backwards from eating a ben\u00e7ao. \u00a0It was crazy!</p>\n<p>All of the excitement could only last but for so long, as we did have to eventually disperse. \u00a0Before leaving, all of the students and the instructors, including the guests, gathered together for a group shot. \u00a0There sure was a hell of a lot of us.</p>\n<p

ended the officially official indoor batizado event, not that it put a halt to the festivities in any way, shape, or form. \u00a0This is, after all, a martial art that&#8217;s founded in Brazilian culture, and Brazilians apparently like to party. \u00a0After cleaning up the area and hauling furniture and food back to their rightful places, the capoeiristas migrated outdoors. \u00a0It was still a sunny day, and there was still much capoeira to be had. \u00a0Once outside, they found a decently-sized spot to play, threw off their shirts, picked up their instruments, and started flying high and fast on the Columbia grass, attracting the attention of any and everyone that had happened to be passing by. \u00a0I watched, and even played a game or two. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t try to jump in too much though, because they were into doing acrobatic stunts, and the best that I could do is a one-handed front handspring. \u00a0Still, it was amazing to watch people twist and fly through the air in sync, and throw kicks left and right at lightning speed.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>After some time, I left. \u00a0It had been a long day, and I was physically and emotionally wiped. \u00a0But, in all of my fatigue and my embarrassment, I had succeeded in becoming something that had quickly come to mean a lot to my life. \u00a0With my brand, spankin&#8217; new light green cord around my waist and the day behind me, I had added to my character.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>I had become a capoeirista.</p>\n</div>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-18T01:20:44", "date_gmt": "2012-01-25T05:27:46", "_links":

about stars that it&#8217;s really difficult to know quite where to start, and my level of exposure to them it&#8217;s also quite difficult to know how to proceed without getting too technical. \u00a0Let&#8217;s start with this: stars are the massive balls of gas in the Universe that shine brightly and live dynamically by way of a constant balance against the inward force of gravity with the outward force of radiative pressure from nuclear fusion. \u00a0Wow, that is definitely a packed sentence. \u00a0Let&#8217;s take it back to basics and build up some understanding so that we can come back and actually appreciate what all of that meant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_39\" style=\"width: 185px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a

data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nevermind all the lines, the apple is falling on this dude&#8217;s head due to gravity!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Gravity always acts radially. \u00a0So, if you have a box full of particles that experience no other force aside from gravity, they will eventually collapse into a sphere (or sphere-like object, depending on what that initial distribution is). \u00a0Gravity doesn&#8217;t make boxes or pyramids, nor does it build buildings or cars. \u00a0It just pulls things 1 and 2 together. \u00a0Gravity is love! \u00a0I digress&#8230;Gravity, as we all know so very well, is responsible for making things on the Earth that go up come back down. \u00a0It&#8217;s also what keeps us tethered to the Earth&#8217;s surface, what keeps the Moon orbiting the Earth, and what keeps the Earth orbiting the Sun. \u00a0The law of gravity, in essence, states that any two physically-existing objects with some mass (call them <i>M1 </i>and <i>M2</i>) that are separated in space by some distance, <i>d</i>, will experience a force that will always act to pull them toward one another. \u00a0This force\u2014this affinity for action\u2014will weaken fairly quickly as the distance grows between these two objects (if the distance doubles, the force between the two objects will reduce to 1/4th of its former strength). However, no matter how far apart they may be, the force will always be there.</p>\n<p>The gas that makes up the physical objects that we know of as stars acts much like that hypothetical box of particles that I mentioned before. \u00a0However, where one might imagine that box of particles with the length of a side comparable to our own size, stars themselves (like our own Sun) are balls of gas that span sizes that are almost beyond our comprehension! \u00a0And this is AFTER the gas has already collapsed from a far-larger reservoir, called a Giant Molecular Cloud (which I may get to in the future). \u00a0Though this may prove to not actually help very much for visualizing this scale, for a sense of scale regarding the size of the Sun (our nearest star), the United States is roughly 2,500 miles wide from east to west. \u00a0According to <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Google Maps</a>, driving from Sacramento, CA to Washington, D.C. covers 2,731 miles and would take&#8230;1.83 days?! \u00a0An average speed of ~62 mph? \u00a0That seems&#8230;a little ambitious&#8230;I&#8217;m digressing again. \u00a0Anyway, in contrast, the average diameter of the Sun is *very roughly* 865,000 (really ~864,950) miles! That amounts to 346 cross-country road trips (or close to 2 years of constant driving) in order to travel from one end of the Sun to the other, going through the center. \u00a0Its circumference on the other hand is *again very roughly* 2.7 million miles. \u00a0It&#8217;s crazy huge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_40\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hydrogen-atom.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hydrogen-atom.jpg?resize=200%2C200\" alt=\"A very artistic and barely-accurate rendering of a hydrogen atom\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hydrogen-atom.jpg?w=200 200w, http://i0.wp.com/rationalwhimsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hydrogen-atom.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A very artistic and barely-accurate<br />rendering of a hydrogen atom</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So, what do we have so far? \u00a0Star&#8217;s are physically large, physically massive, and are made of gas that is gravitationally bound to itself. \u00a0Awesome, we have progress. \u00a0However, out of these facts come an interesting question: with all of this mass experiencing all of this gravitational force pulling everything inward, how is it that all of this material doesn&#8217;t just collapse indefinitely until it becomes just an extremely massive point in space? \u00a0An initial guess might be that the atoms that comprise this gas act like solid billiard balls, where the gas ensemble will compact down in volume until each atomic &#8220;sphere&#8221; is physically touching the next one. \u00a0Let&#8217;s do a quick and dirty calculation of what that might be like (Christ, there will be so many approximations&#8230;.).Packed within this gargantuan volume is enough gas to equate to ~333,000 Earth masses. \u00a0The stuff that comprises this gas isn&#8217;t what we usually think of when we think of gas (certainly not what&#8217;s in your car). \u00a0It is almost entirely a gas of hydrogen atoms (~75% hydrogen and ~25% helium\u00a0by mass,\u00a0but they exist in an almost 12:1 ratio by number in our own Sun; the ratio may be even higher when you account for the mass fraction of heavier elements), which themselves are extreeeeemely tiny (using the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom, you can fit ~700,000 hydrogen atoms along the width of a single hair), and are extreeeeemely light (I could give a sense-of-scale factoid here, but I don&#8217;t feel like it). \u00a0Hydrogen is honestly worthy of its own article, but that&#8217;s for another time. \u00a0What I will say about basic hydrogen (there are isotopes, as well as ionization states), that hasn&#8217;t already been said within parentheses, is that it is the most basic atom in existence, with each atom being composed of a single proton orbited by a single electron (though the force that keeps the electron tethered is <b><i>not</i></b> gravity!). \u00a0This will become useful later.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s first approximate the Sun as a hypothetical star being entirely comprised of hydrogen atoms. \u00a0This comes out to roughly ~10^57 atoms (this symbol &#8220;^&#8221; means &#8220;the numbers following this are the exponent of the preceding number&#8221;) if you divide the mass of the Sun by the mass of an individual hydrogen atom. \u00a0Each of these atoms has a radius of roughly 5.3 x 10^(-11) meters, resulting in a volume for every atom of ~6.2 x 10^(-31) cubic meters. \u00a0I&#8217;m going to do something really stupid and highly incorrect and invert this, giving a number density (# of atoms per unit volume) of one atom per 6.2&#215;10^(-31) cubic meters, or 1.6 x 10^30 atoms per cubic meter of space. \u00a0Given that we have ~10^57 atoms in this hypothetical pure hydrogen star, we divide the total number of atoms by the number density of atoms, giving ~6 x 10^26 cubic meters for the volume of our pure-hydrogen star. \u00a0Now, if you look up the radius of the Sun and do the volume calculation, you get something like 1.4 x 10^27 cubic meters for the Sun&#8217;s volume. \u00a0Then, you can look at the two numbers side by side and say, considering all the approximations we made along the way, that this could possibly work.</p>\n<p>HOWEVER, remember that the Sun is not purely hydrogen, and instead has roughly 1 helium atom per 12 hydrogen atoms, with the size of an individual helium atom being roughly 60% of a hydrogen atom. \u00a0Thus if we were to make our hypothetical star a little more realistic and include helium, as well as some of the heavier elements present in the Sun like oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, neon, and even iron, our hypothetical star with atoms bumping up against one another like billiard balls begins to shrink drastically in size, and the volume may decrease by an order of magnitude (meaning a factor of 10, and no I do not have a calculation for that.). \u00a0But, the Sun is puffed up to a much greater volume than that. \u00a0On top of that, the Sun also shines, which an inert ball of hydrogen billiard balls cannot do. \u00a0What gives? \u00a0What is it that&#8217;s holding the Sun up against that ever-present collapse of gravity? \u00a0The answer: <b>radiative pressure</b>.</p>\n<p class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zp55oIKRml4/UGYiu_OLXrI/AAAAAAAAAIM/WJmOXE5Y-Ac/s1600/incandescent-light-bulbs-lg.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zp55oIKRml4/UGYiu_OLXrI/AAAAAAAAAIM/WJmOXE5Y-Ac/s200/incandescent-light-bulbs-lg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"156\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Radiative pressure is a fancy way of saying the force produced on a surface by\u00a0<i>light</i>, that same phenomenon that makes it so that we can see the world around us. \u00a0You might be thinking to yourself, aside from my argument above being&#8230;fairly weak, &#8220;self, what the hell is he talking about? \u00a0You need something that has the ability to PUSH in order to hold against gravity! \u00a0Light doesn&#8217;t push anything, it just shines!&#8221; \u00a0Well, mon fr\u00e8re, that is where you&#8217;re wrong. \u00a0Light (another topic to discuss at great and painful length! Woo!) is energy, and has the ability to imbue particles with motion when it interacts with matter (in many different ways that will be detailed later). \u00a0This motion can then translate into a pressure, as these newly-energized particles smack up against other particles and physically push them outward. \u00a0But how, pray tell, does this light get produced? \u00a0What is the source at the center of it all?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_41\" style=\"width: 236px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The proton-proton chain of nuclear fusion</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So now what do we have? \u00a0We&#8217;ve discussed that stars are giant balls of gas. \u00a0We&#8217;ve covered that these giant balls of gas are bound together by gravity, but are held up against collapse by radiative pressure. \u00a0We&#8217;ve also covered that this radiative pressure is due to nuclear fusion occurring in their cores. \u00a0And so, stars live dynamically, balancing radiative pressure against gravity! \u00a0It&#8217;s dynamic because there&#8217;s constant action in this stand-off. \u00a0If the radiative pressure relents just a bit, gravity acts right away to contract the star. \u00a0If gravity contracts the star just a bit, the core will heat up from this contraction, and the radiative output will increase, puffing the star back up. \u00a0Now that I&#8217;ve gotten through all that, where do we go from here? \u00a0There&#8217;s just so much to cover. \u00a0I think that next time, I&#8217;ll start talking about all of the different types of stars and their physical and observational properties, moving up through their evolution, and going over how different stars die. \u00a0I&#8217;d like to go into detail about every stellar population, just so that we (read: I) have a good idea of what makes each population special. \u00a0I&#8217;d then like to go into how they&#8217;re distributed throughout the galaxy, whether they&#8217;re in clusters or are cruising along in the galactic field, and how their locations and compositions tell us more about the galaxy that we live in. \u00a0After that, I think it might be a good time to cut the star stuff, because there&#8217;s so much more of the natural world to explore, and I&#8217;m interested to see what I can dig up.<i>FUUUUUUUUUSION!!!</i>\u00a0 Hydrogen in the core of the Sun is packed together really tightly, and is fairly heavily ionized, meaning that the central proton has been stripped of its electron companion. \u00a0It&#8217;s also really hot (~27 million degrees Fahrenheit, vs ~10,300\u00b0 F on the Sun&#8217;s surface, and ~1,800\u00b0 F for magma on Earth), and heat makes things want to move, so these free protons in high densities jet around really really quickly. \u00a0Now, for visualization, try to imagine yourself in any given mall on Black Friday. \u00a0It&#8217;s extremely crowded, and everyone within the mall is trying to move as quickly as they can in order to get to a sale. \u00a0Inevitably these people will collide, sometimes even with you. \u00a0Let&#8217;s take this analogy back to the Sun, where we instead have protons colliding at very high energies. \u00a0When people in the mall collide when they&#8217;re under high pressure, in high density, and are really hot, they tend to explode into a fight. \u00a0When protons collide under these conditions, they fuse into a single nucleus of one proton and one neutron called deuterium, which one can think of as heavy hydrogen. \u00a0The reaction also produces a positron (the antimatter form of an electron), a neutrino (a mysterious little particle that seems to only interact with matter when it feels like it), and a little energy that is given off in the form of light. \u00a0The positron eventually goes on to meet up with a free electron, annihilate, and produce some energy. \u00a0The next leg of fusion, the major energy-releasing part, occurs when another free proton smacks into the deuterium atom, creating helium-3 (called as such because there&#8217;s 3 particles comprising it&#8217;s nucleus: 2 protons and 1 neutron), and releasing energy in the form of light. \u00a0This is all amazing and whatnot, but it is important to note that the time scale for a single proton-proton fusion interaction is on the order of one billion years per reaction. \u00a0This would be an incredibly long wait if not for the fact that there are far more than billions of protons in the Sun&#8217;s core. \u00a0The sheer vastness in the number of protons in this region means that even though the time scale is so long, every second there are roughly 3.6 x 10^38 protons going through the reaction and being converted into helium nuclei. \u00a0This, according to Wikipedia, releases energy at a rate of ~9.1 x 10^10 megatons of TNT per second! \u00a0PER SECOND! \u00a0That&#8217;s about the power in 9 billion nuclear bombs of the highest yield, PER SECOND. \u00a0Crazy. \u00a0Stars are objects that are at constant nuclear war, with themselves, in order to stay alive. \u00a0That&#8217;s some serious personal issues.</p>\n<p>At\u00e9 ent\u00e3o!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*<i>Physical quantities like the mass of hydrogen and diameter of the Sun were obtained from the textbook that I used to TA for Astronomy 101 last quarter, whatever that is. \u00a0I don&#8217;t feel like looking for it. \u00a0It&#8217;s got stars on the front. \u00a0Unit conversions from km to miles, as well as all calculations were done by me using anything from IDL to my Macbook&#8217;s Spotlight calculator to my iPhone, and may be a little (or a lot) off due to rounding errors and general laziness. \u00a0This is certainly not an ultimately-reliable source for facts and figures, just an astronomer rambling about stuff that gets him excited. \u00a0Enjoy for your own pleasure, but cite at your own peril!</i></p>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-18T01:20:18", "date_gmt": "2012-01-22T05:15:47", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=37",

definitely a year of expansion for me, and as such I have had a rapid expansion of goals. \u00a0I actually want to remember these, so I made myself a separate file and just listed essentially all of the things that I&#8217;d like to either accomplish fully, or make some damn good progress toward in the coming year. \u00a0I then remembered that I had started this blog and decided that I could put them up here, and maybe even add a little bit of explanation on each item.</p>\n<p>My view of New Year&#8217;s Resolutions might be somewhat different than most people&#8217;s. \u00a0The impression that I get is that most people make a resolution, and if they don&#8217;t hold to it then they feel like the scum of the Earth. \u00a0My way of thinking about resolutions is thus: they&#8217;re just a list of goals that I want to work toward. \u00a0If I don&#8217;t achieve them, then I don&#8217;t achieve them. \u00a0But, as long as I make progress toward these goals, I&#8217;m alright. \u00a0And, if I happen to actually accomplish any of these, then even better! \u00a0It means that I&#8217;ve managed to take an active role in improving my life, and there&#8217;s documented change!

astronomy graduate coursework. \u00a0It&#8217;s essentially a rite of passage for those hoping to continue on to obtaining their doctorate. \u00a0When it&#8217;s taken after the first year, failure is expected, as it very well should be. \u00a0You&#8217;re being tested on two years of knowledge after only one year of instruction. \u00a0You are, though, expected to fail gracefully, hitting that first year of knowledge pretty solidly on the exam. \u00a0It is possible for people to pass the exam in the first year, and actually happened with one of the guys in my cohort. \u00a0Once it&#8217;s

disappointing, and really gets you a lot of unwanted looks of pity. \u00a0It also means that you only have one more shot, which adds to the stress of taking it a third time. \u00a0You can of course take it a third time, but if you don&#8217;t pass that third time, they hand you a master&#8217;s degree and then show you the door (I think. \u00a0To my knowledge, no one here has hit that third strike).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p>**\u00a0<i>Control of my angular momentum when performing the armada and meia lua de compasso kicks \u2013\u00a0</i>These are two kicks in capoeira that require a lot of spinning. \u00a0<b>Armada</b>\u00a0makes you spin while standing up, and <b>compasso</b>\u00a0makes you spin while crouched. \u00a0As it currently stands, I can usually land solidly like I&#8217;m supposed to after each kick, buuuuuut every so often I do lose my balance when I finish and it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m spinning too hard to control my legs.</p>\n</div>\n<div

when the two players are weaving in and out of each other&#8217;s spaces, and usually these are jogo de dentro type games. \u00a0I also want to just work on my low game in general.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p>****\u00a0<i>Practice with Manganga consistently \u2013\u00a0</i>Mangang\u00e1 is this dude I met through two other angoleiros who&#8217;s really cool and offers angola classes at his school in south Seattle, the Seattle Capoeira Center <a href=\"http://seattlecapoeiracenter.com/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">(here)</a>. \u00a0He had offered a promotion last month, where if any of his Facebook friends wanted to come and take a morning class from him, it&#8217;d be for free. \u00a0So, I went to one on a Wednesday, at 6:45 in the morning. \u00a0It was one of the tougher classes that I&#8217;ve been in, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. \u00a0He seemed to also enjoy my being there and extended to me an offer of joining him regularly, with personalized coaching! \u00a0I decided to take him up on his offer, so starting next week (it was supposed to be this week, but snow halted everything), I&#8217;ll be getting my ass kicked every Wednesday and Friday morning, alongside my Senzala practice on Tues, Thurs, and Saturdays. \u00a0I&#8217;ll probably also be keeping up practice on my own on Sundays and Mondays. \u00a0We&#8217;ll see how this turns out!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p>*****\u00a0<i>Get to New York for the Guerreiros batizado \u2013\u00a0</i>When I first started capoeira (almost exactly two years ago), I started in New York, at Columbia University with <a href=\"http://capoeiraguerreiros.org/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Capoeira Guerreiros</a>. \u00a0I got my first corda (something like the belts in Karate) with them at my first Batizado (portuguese for &#8220;baptism&#8221;), 2+ months after I had originally began. \u00a0It was one of the most fun things that I had ever done. \u00a0Unfortunately, I moved to Seattle that August, and thus stopped practicing with Guerreiros. \u00a0They&#8217;ve had a couple batizados since then, and I haven&#8217;t been able to make any of them because I&#8217;m broke and cannot afford to fly back to NY. \u00a0I&#8217;d like to be able to make it back and see how everyone&#8217;s improved in the past two years, and maybe even show off a little for them too.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p>******\u00a0<i>Dive back into Portuguese as soon as the Qualifying Exam is over \u2013\u00a0</i>As part of my desire to become a great capoeirista, I want to learn Portuguese, which is the language of the activity. \u00a0I actually started formally learning it last quarter with a great teacher, and even made a few friends in the class, but toward the end of the quarter it became increasingly demanding (as it very well should). \u00a0It was so demanding that it had become difficult to learn the language and keep up with my actual graduate responsibilities. \u00a0So, with much pain in my heart, I decided to discontinue it this quarter so that I could focus solidly on my work. \u00a0I&#8217;m not giving up on it though! \u00a0Once my classes are through, I&#8217;m diving back into it, head first!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p>*******\u00a0<i>Settle on a dissertation subject area \u2013\u00a0</i>In astronomy, most people aren&#8217;t interested in every single thing that the field has to offer. \u00a0Some people like planets and planetary systems (not me), some people like stars (hell yeah!), some people like Milky Way structure (I can dig it), some people like extragalactic astronomy, and others like large-scale structure, amongst many other things beyond and between. \u00a0I know that I&#8217;m pretty heavily interested in stars, but I am no where close to narrowing my interests down to something that can serve as the basis of a dissertation. \u00a0There&#8217;s so much to do with stars, and I just have so much left to learn. \u00a0This year though, I&#8217;m sure that I can get towards something that I can continue to study for the next 4.5 years.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<p>********\u00a0<i>See a psychologist at least once this year \u2013\u00a0</i>There&#8217;s nothing that I think is expressly wrong with me mentally. \u00a0However, over the past few years I&#8217;ve been through a few things that have produced varying amounts of trauma, and I&#8217;ve wanted to talk it out with a mental health professional. \u00a0On top of that, I kinda just want to talk to someone who has no other connection to my life about me. \u00a0Someone who&#8217;s supposed to be objective, and just have them listen to my story. \u00a0We&#8217;ll see how well I stick to this one.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p1\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-18T01:20:05", "date_gmt": "2012-01-20T04:49:57", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href":

homework assignments, when one of my friends who also happens to be there late appears at my door. \u00a0She tells me that she was getting ready to go and spend time with her boyfriend and wait through the oncoming snow storm at home. \u00a0She went on about how there was supposed to be up to 14 inches of accumulation between midnight and the next midnight, and how I should probably get home so that I don&#8217;t get snowed in. \u00a0Now, because I was in my office late and completely absorbed by what I was doing, I was completely taken by surprise by this announcement of inclement weather. \u00a0It also didn&#8217;t help much that when I looked out of my window, the skies (of SEATTLE!!!) were <i>essentially\u00a0</i>clear, and not a single flake had fallen yet from the sky. \u00a0I gave her a quizzical look and a sarcastic &#8220;ok, yeah. \u00a0I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow then.&#8221; \u00a0So she left, I kept working, and at some point later on in the night I left to go to my own home.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Now there was already some snow on the ground, but this had been from the weekend. \u00a0It couldn&#8217;t have been more than 3 inches that had accumulated, but even this much holds the ability to SHUT SEATTLE DOWN!!!11!1one!!1uno! \u00a0However, by this point in the night it had more or less been moved out of the street, and no new snow was falling onto the ground. \u00a0It was dumb cold though. \u00a0Anyway, I hopped on the next bus home and walked home from my stop. \u00a0I got home at around 10:30 pm and hung out with my girlfriend, periodically looking outside to see where this fabled blizzard was.</p>\n<p>When we woke up this morning, we saw that the &#8220;snowstorm&#8221; had indeed come. \u00a0A whole 4-8 inches! WOW! \u00a0Yeah, they cancelled all classes for the day due to what really amounts to no more than a heavy dusting. \u00a0I stayed home because I had no real burning desire to head down to my office only to do the same stuff I ended up doing here today, and slept in a wee bit later (like 9am) than I had originally intended (like 5:30 am).</p>\n<p>I decided to be a beacon of virtue in the world and help out my apartment manager, Alan, shovel the walkway in our residential complex out to the street. \u00a0I figured it&#8217;d be a nice thing to do, especially considering that he&#8217;s fairly advanced in age and walks with an oxygen pack, and he had done me a huge solid last week. \u00a0So, we coordinated by phone, rallied our forces, collected some shovels from the basement and got out there. \u00a0It couldn&#8217;t have taken more than 10 minutes to shovel the walkway out to the stairs, clean the stairs, clear the courtyard, and shovel all the way out to the street. This brilliant idea then entered my mind: &#8220;hey, Nick, check it out. \u00a0You have this shovel in your hand, and an entire to day to do literally whatever the hell you want. \u00a0Why don&#8217;t you try your hand at shoveling some walk ways for money! \u00a0You could charge like $10-20 and make a hefty sum by lunch!&#8221; I asked Alan for his shovel and his blessing, which he gave freely. \u00a0I then set off on what would be a very short and disappointing venture into independent employment (a sign of things to come?).</p>\n<p>I decided to turn down the nearest street and just go door-to-door. \u00a0You know, the old fashioned way. \u00a0First house I stop at, I ring the doorbell twice and wait, standing proudly with my shovel: my gateway to outrageous fortune. \u00a0A young dude answers the door and I give him my shpiel about shoveling his walkway, sidewalk, and driveway for $10. \u00a0As I&#8217;m giving my sales pitch, I look out at the walkway and start to feel pretty silly. \u00a0His walkway couldn&#8217;t have been more than 30 feet long, and remember the accumulation throughout Seattle is only about 4-6 inches. \u00a0In addition to that, when I&#8217;m done giving my pitch, he informs me that he already swept (SWEPT! \u00a0I&#8217;m carrying a damn shovel and he did the same job with a BROOM!) his pathways off earlier and will probably just go out and do it again later. \u00a0I nod, accept the brief defeat, wish him a good day, and go across the street to try at the next house. \u00a0For every subsequent house, the story is either similar, or is some other valid reason as to why my services were not needed. \u00a0Either they were young, not lazy, and could do it themselves, or they were older and had one of the young kids in the neighborhood do it for free.</p>\n<p>After about 15 minutes of consistent rejection, it occurred to me that my time was probably better spent in my apartment, catching up on work that I&#8217;m currently a week (or more) late on. \u00a0So, I dragged my sorry self back home and told Alan to give me a heads up if the snow builds up again and needed swift conquering.</p>\n<p>I then proceeded to be&#8230;mildly productive. \u00a0Knocked out a little bit of homework, graded some quizzes, entered those grades and homework grades into the grade book, sent out some emails for class, and listened to a bunch of podcasts on <a href=\"http://risk-show.com/\" data-blogger-escaped-target=\"_blank\">Risk</a>. \u00a0And then I decided to start a blog.</p>\n<p>Ah, winter&#8230;</p>\n"}, "modified": "2015-09-18T01:19:56", "date_gmt": "2012-01-18T04:44:16", "_links": {"wp:term": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=21", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "category"}, {"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=21", "embeddable": true, "taxonomy": "post_tag"}], "curies": [{"href": "https://api.w.org/{rel}", "name": "wp", "templated": true}], "self": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/21"}], "version-history": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/21/revisions"}], "collection": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}], "wp:featuredmedia": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/30", "embeddable": true}], "replies": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=21", "embeddable": true}], "author": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1", "embeddable": true}], "wp:attachment": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=21"}], "about": [{"href": "http://rationalwhimsy.com/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}]}, "excerpt": {"protected": false, "rendered": "<p>Picture courtesy of one of my coworkers&#8217; facebook albums.
