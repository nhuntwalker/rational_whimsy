# Rational Whimsy

**Author**: Nicholas Hunt-Walker

This is the code that builds my website, http://www.rationalwhimsy.com.
It's written in Django, and serves as my one-stop-shop for all my stuff.
This includes but is not limited to:

* Blog Posts
* Live projects
* Project listings
* Idea drawing board
* Other interests
